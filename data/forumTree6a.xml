Discussion Question 1: By Friday, November 17, 2008 - Find information about the change from analog to digital television (All Digital Television is Coming (Sooner than You Think!)) and answer the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please post your links or references.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is estimated that 36 million people who now only get free television with an aerial will be affected by the switch to digital TV in February, 2009. How is the industry worked to make sure people are not disenfranchised? How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.&lt;br/&gt;

1.    1. The government and TV networks have done a good job to promote the change, the one problem that I have seen is that people think they are going to have to buy a High Def TV to get the new signal. The government is giving consumers a $40 dollar voucher to help pay for a digital converter box.
2.     2. 
a.    The FCC has described the 700 MHz as beachfront property, and has talked up the broadband capabilities of this spectrum swath. About 60 MHz of the former UHF (TV) spectrum is going to be reclaimed by the U.S. government and will be reallocated for public safety and commercial broadband networks, The TV channels using this spectrum are going to go dark on Feb. 19, 2009. 
b.    Google has announced that they will be throwing in their bid at the FCC&amp;rsquo;s $4.6 billion reserve price, but only if the FCC agrees to Google&amp;rsquo;s expanded demands for open access. Eric Schmidt, Google CEO, says that if the FCC will agree to open applications, open devices, open services, and open networks.
c.     The auction could net Google a prime piece of spectrum real estate from which to launch their very own wireless broadband network. We&amp;rsquo;re all for Google winning the auction - consumers would benefit from widely available, open access just as much as Google would. 
3.     3. Like every business if they want to stay profitable they need to change and adapt to the new technology and demands. Cable have changed in the last 10 years with the beginning of broadband signal they have been able to enhance their products from internet service to on demand programming that give people they opportunity to watch shows when they want to.

                Congress has created a coupon program for the digital T.V. converter box. Each coupon is worth $40 and you may obtain two per household.  The industry touts that it will provide a better picture quality and consumers will have more programming options. More information can be found at the following website. http://www.dtv.gov/consumercorner.html
How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?
                The government has allocated $1.5 billion to inform 17 million citizens about the digital T.V. transition. The Federal Communications Commission has created the website www.dtv.gov to inform people about the switch. I have also received pamphlets in the mail that explains the reasons and procedures to upgrade to digital reception. 
Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.

http://news.cnet.com/FAQ-What-the-digital-TV-switch-actually-means/2100-1026_3-6228433.html

It is estimated that 36 million people who now only get free television with an aerial will be affected by the switch to digital TV in February, 2009. How is the industry worked to make sure people are not disenfranchised? How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?

The government and industry are both going to great lengths to ensure that everyone is fully aware and prepared for the coming switch. There are regular commercials on television and radio about what we all can expect and what certain consumers (aerial-users) will need to do. Cable companies are using the switch to promote their products. &apos;Sign up with us, and you won&amp;rsquo;t have a thing to worry about!&amp;rdquo; The government has established dtv.com and explains the situation in non-commercial terms. While the overall goal may be to make money, the government isn&amp;rsquo;t looking to make money off of the people who will lose analog service. (Most families who still use analog do so because they have low income and cannot afford the luxury of cable Instead, they offer $40 coupons to be used towards a digital converter so that few people will really be put out by the switch.
 
Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations.

I think common sense can tell us that the real motivation is money. Why go to all the trouble and cost (providing millions in free coupons) just so we can all watch The Hills with a perfect digital picture? That&amp;rsquo;s no motivation for the government or the industry. And it makes sense, I think, to switch to a broadcast method that uses less bandwidth, thereby freeing up space for more. We get more programming/other services, and the government and industry make more money, all for a relatively low cost and  hassle to the public at large.

Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find much on the subject of why we&amp;rsquo;re switching (beyond picture quality), but this Massachusetts site briefly touches on the monetary rewards.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t think we really need someone to come out and say that&amp;rsquo;s the reason. A little knowledge of economics and common sense proves that there must be a financial reason for the switch. That&amp;rsquo;s the motive behind most decisions, really.
 
Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.

Technology is changing and improving all the time. The trend seems to be that things constantly get better and, eventually, cheaper. Cable and broadcast companies will look to technology to see how they can provide a better service at a lower cost (to attract more business) and still make a higher profit.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 12 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='69074'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 12 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='22-11-08 11:01:14'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227369674'/><attribute name='author' value='Amanda Buelow'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree this puts the american consumer out by making them shell out more moeny for something they may not want.

Congress mandated this action and said that after this time no television will be broadcast I analog. They say some of the good reasons we are switching over is because people like the police, and fire departments will be able to free up some of the broadcast spectrum for public safety communications.  Consumers will benefit because the quality of the programs will be much better. The picture quality will be super sharp. The change of digital television also offers broadcasting of more than one digital channel at a time, and they can use the same amount of spectrum that they used to use with analog. The companies are working to making sue everyone isn&amp;rsquo;t disenfranchised by because they are offering people the ability to use their old television and add a converter box. A digital-to-analog converter box will allow you to continue using your existing analog TV to watch &apos;over-the-air&amp;rdquo; digital broadcasts. You do not need to get rid of your existing analog TV. 
The government is offering some help when comes to people being able to buy these new converter boxes. The FCC is making sure everyone can tune in to the future of television. Each American household is eligible for up to two $40 coupons for digital to analog converter boxes. The government has not incorporated much thought about this change. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t form internet research, I would have not even known this information. What about the people who do not have access to the internet to learn and research this information. I have not heard much about this on the news, or on advertisements. There have been some commercials on television about this switch to digital. The commercial industry is responsible for reaching out to consumers and keeping them updated on the latest technologies. The government has not gone far enough to educate people on the change. For example, before this assignment I wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully aware of the switch.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about the switch, however, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully aware of what we need to do in order to keep in touch with television. 
The argument is very interesting about whether or not the internet switch was for money or for picture quality. Most of the research I&amp;rsquo;ve done on this issue stated that the switch was linked to the fact they want to change over for a better picture quality. Some of the sites I&amp;rsquo;ve seen was: 
http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/15745147.html
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080201000129AAk9WtD
They say the actual reason they are switching over is because this will free up some more space for other uses. But my question is where this money goes that they receive from the switch. They will receive billons from this switch. One blog that I read said, maybe the government will use this money for the war. Who knows the reason behind any of these things? 
The change in technology definitely contributes to this change. Technology changes everyday and they find new ways to switch and convert the technologies we use everyday. The change is important because this reflects how we are evolving as a society.

            Though it remains a mystery and there is controversy behind the real reason for switching to all digital television, the industry and government are being very proactive in informing people about the switch from analog television to digital television in February of 2009.  They are airing plenty of commercials that give useful tips as to what anyone with analog television must do briefly on television, and than offering websites where detailed help and further assistance are readily available. There is also funding being offered by the government where they reimburse you for the money you spend switching analog to digital television. According to articles I have read the reasoning behind this switch to being done because they want people to have to buy a new television that accepts digital signal or a converter box, both of which are said to have built in cameras so that the government may watch our every move. Technology drives decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations immensely. This is in large part due to the fact that technology is their outlet that connects them to their audiences and gets them paid well and so when technology moves forward, advances, or changes they must accommodate it in order to be successful.

I can assure you that teh Digital boxes offered whre i work hav been around for years now, way before this transition was set to take place and I know for a fact they do not have cameras built in. If spying was the case then the people who currently have digital boxes would be requird to return them in exchange for new boxes. This is not the case here, people who currently have digital boxes can keep their old boxes.I definitly agree with you when you say technology is what connects cable to their audiences and tehy really do ned to accomadate in order to be successful, especially when the market is as competitive as it is nowadays.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='68974'/></branch></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 12'/><attribute name='message_id' value='69039'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 12'/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 22:41:17'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227325277'/><attribute name='author' value='Patrick McCollum'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/services/2007-08-06-digital-tv-cover_n.htm

This article talks about the upcoming switch to all digital TV broadcasts, however it takes a closer look at the consumer perspective.  In the article, they say that as many as 60% of the population does not know about the upcoming switch.  Also, many television sets that will not work once the switch over takes place are still being sold in stores as well as being in stock at certain retail stores.  Retailers are placing warning labels on the television sets that will not work in order to inform the customer before the purchase. In order to counteract the consumer lack of education, a wave of public service announcements were created to accuratly inform people of the upcoming changes.  The government also has coupon program to help people save money that are forced to buy a converter box. The article does mention that the bandwith will be auctioned off by the government for millions of dollars.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 12 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='69392'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 12 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='23-11-08 22:26:43'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227497203'/><attribute name='author' value='Janice David'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I found that statistic to be really interesting, 60% is alot.

Everytime I watch tv I notice commercials for the changoever, and I feel the major networks are doing this because they do not want to lose viewers and the money they make off of advertising.

The true motivation for the switch to digital is to benefit the consumer. It will free up frequencies for public safety communication and it will be used for commercial wireless services for the consumer. Many countries are working to switch over to digital.
http://www.wcmu.org/tv/dtv_Conversion.html

The most interesting fact is that Luxembourg was the first to implement this and other countries are following suit. This is fascinating because if anyone knows anything about Luxembourg, if you drive in a car for an hour and fifteen minutes you can drive across the whole country. I am sure that the impact is no where near as grand or the process as tedious as it will be for the larger countries such as the United States and Australia.

There is also a website available for questions and answers regarding the change. https://www.dtv2009.gov The site is also the source for households to request up to two $40 coupons to help pay for the conversion boxes, if needed.
I listen to NPR and have heard commercials regarding Michigan Public TV (PBS) but have not really heard or seen anything anywhere else. Perhaps that station has commercials, I don&apos;t watch enough tv to say, but other then listening to NPR I would not have known that PBS will be converting earlier! November 19th was the date. In typing this, I turned my TV and checked out the channel. I don&apos;t have my converter box set up yet, and there it was....? Maybe I don&apos;t need the box? Guess I am going to have to check out my TV more (haha.)

I did not find any articles of experts saying that the motivation is money. I did find many articles stating the motivation is to clear up air waves for an increase of public safety. I found this interesting, because I never really knew why. While although there is a benefit of clearer pictures and sound. I assumed it was just to become more advanced, broadcasting companies more effecient, and pour some money into the economy. I didn&apos;t realize that it is in correlation with 911 and Katrina. The problems faced during that time were clogs in air waves, due to so much use. Freeing up the analog air waves will give more space and opportunity for public safety (police, fire fighters, ambulance workers) to communicate in such a crisis. http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/News/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=6682

Technology drives decisions by companies, because if you are not moving forward you are either going backward or standing still. The demands of the public for faster more convienent sources create a need for new technology. There is more money to be made if you get in at the begining, and ride the wave, rather then wait for the last splash. Let&apos;s face it, they are in the business to make money - bottom line.

A couple of issues that the conversion faces is that of a &apos;big brother&apos; conspiracy. http://educate-yourself.org/lte/HDtvcovertsurveillanceagenda12apr08.shtml 
It&apos;s interesting to read about people&apos;s perspectives and fears. I have a friend that does not want to get a governement coupon and thinks that by paying more money for the box will prohibit the government from knowing who he is and activating some sort of spying device in his box. The fear is real and out there more then I had thought.

Another issue with the boxes is that consumers quickly got thier coupons as the program kicked off, but then the manufacturers could not keep up with the demand. I work in retail and saw first hand the minimal amount of boxes that we got in and the hundreds of people who wanted to purchase them. Coupons expired and they can not get a replacement coupon. One site stated that in thier state 52% of allocatted coupons expired, because the demand was too great. Hopefully the governement can fix this problem for them.

There are many consumers not happy with the $10-20 cost (with coupon) or $50-$60 cost (without a coupon.) But I have read that when Germany switched over, it cost them $200/box! Wow! http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/04/digital_tv.html

I&apos;m sure the government could find an easier way to notify the public in case of emergencies.

Maybe we don&apos;t hear about the business reasons behind the switch because they don&apos;t really matter. It&apos;s not as if the government is engaging in some secret, underhanded operation to defraud the public. As far as I can tell, this decision benefits everyone and hurts (probably) no one, especially since coupons are being provided to analog users. If more money can be made, awesome. If public safety improves, even better.

One of the main ways that the industry is using to inform people about the switch is through advertisements. 

The best example is the common commercials that are currently seen on TV networks. They give information about how to obtain converter boxes. Also, the website DTV Answers gives information about the switchover. 

While one of the main aruguements for the switchover is better quality, some speculate that it is more about making money by selling the rights to new bandwidth ranges. This is more than just speculation as I found information regarding it on the DTV Answers website. 

They state that, &apos;Going all-digital will free up parts of the airwaves for future innovative services by entrepreneurs. TV stations can also improve their services with enhanced closed captioning, better pictures and sound, and offer several channels of programming at the same time, known as &apos;multicasting.&apos;

If this website is willing to give such detailed information, then it is pretty obvious that the real motivation for the switch is to generate money.

Technology definately drives the decisions of the cable and broadcast TV organizations, but it only does so to a certain extent.  Using the switchover that we are examining as an example, it is easy to see that technology only drives the decisions as long as it is helping to further bring in money for the companies. If the technology would bring in less money, then that technology would undoubtedly be suppressed to a certain extent, definately not promoted to the point of a &apos;forced switchover&apos; like we are currently seeing.

The industry has worked to ensure that the public is aware of the transition by advertising on television and on billboards that change is coming and that people need to make the switch.
 
How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?
Industry and the government are working in partnership to educate consumers by advertising on television and on billboards.  According to the DTV website there are even speakers that will come to your community to discuss the transition.  They have also introduced a coupon for the converter boxes to assist in the cost associated with switching from analog to digital television.

Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.
 
It seems there are arguments for the cause to change to digital that would allow up to 4 channels to be broadcast through the same spectrum by switching to digital vs. the one per, as is the case currently with analog.  But there are also financial benefits by selling the old spectrums to other companies for, of course, a profit.  I tend to believe that the switch is not provoked by better picture quality at all; with digital the broadcasters can do more with less and that&amp;rsquo;s the way we all try to live.  Attached is an article that discusses the profits to be had by selling of the spectrums:

As soon as it became official, they began bombarding the public with commercials and information about the transition and offering coupons for converter boxes to the millions of individuals who do not currently have digital television. They are also heavily promoting the advantages of digital television over analog such as higher-quality picture, sound and more programming choices. 

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration launched the TV Converter Box Coupon Program that allows households request up to two coupons, worth $40 towards the purchase of a digital-to-analog converter box, which range from around $40 to $200.

Many government-funded and corporate organizations, such as the National Association of Broadcasters, have created websites like the ones above to educate the public about the transition. Many of these same groups are also offering telephone help-lines and advertisements in order to inform the public and make sure everyone is prepared for the transition.

I am sure that the potential revenue from selling off the newly available bandwidth was also a large consideration in the decision to mandate the conversion, seeing as how strongly our government is influenced by commerce. But, in doing all my researching, I really did not come across much negative information or responses to the transition. I did, however, learn something new regarding how the transition will benefit other agencies besides the government and conglomerates.

The first two links and excerpts I have included below talk about how the switch will benefit our public safety services (police, fire and emergency rescue units) across the country by increasing the amount of frequencies available to these agencies.

The last link and excerpt explains how much money is involved in the selling of the bandwidth. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing what the value is for technology these days&amp;hellip;maybe we will be able to pay off the bailout sooner than we think&amp;hellip;if the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t mishandle it.

www.videouniversity.com/dtv.shtml

&apos;Congress mandated the conversion to DTV for two important reasons. First, Digital TV provides higher quality picture and sound and it allows more programming options via multiple broadcast streams. Second, stopping analog broadcasting will free up a wide range of frequencies so they can be used for public safety such as police, fire, and emergency rescue communications, as well as commercial uses.&amp;rdquo;

www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/dtv/

&apos;As the nation transitions from analog to digital, NTIA will also help enable first responders -- our firefighters and police officers -- to employ designated frequencies to improve their communications, thereby better protecting communities when emergencies arise. The Administration will continue to monitor developments and encourage its successful deployment, which will result in reclaimed radio spectrum for other important services, including public safety.&amp;rdquo;

www.todaysengineer.org/2005/Dec/spectrum.asp

&apos;After the DTV transition is completed, stations will return their analog spectrum to the FCC, which it will then auction it off. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government will pocket $10 billion by auctioning off the spectrum; some believe it could fetch a great deal more. By some estimates, four TV channels (24 MHz) could fetch $15 billion on the private market &amp;mdash; 50 percent higher than the haul the government expects to bring in from the auction of the returned analog TV channels.&amp;rdquo;

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.

Cable providers will strongly promote their digital services, encouraging people who previously used an antenna with an analog television to switch to digital cable and previous customers to upgrade. Broadcast stations that have already made the transition to digital are incurring the cost of transmitting both digital and analog signals, so they are anxiously awaiting the conversion. Because digital channels take up less bandwidth, broadcasters can provide more channels, HDTV and non-television services.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='week12'/><attribute name='message_id' value='68952'/><attribute name='message_title' value='week12'/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 15:09:09'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227298149'/><attribute name='author' value='Fallon Cavazos'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='http://www.dtvanswers.com/newsroom/dtv_insert.pdf

February 17,2009 marks the day which television switches from analog to digital.  The switch to digital will provide better quaility for audio and visual, and also services like &apos;multicasting&apos;.  Muliticasting is the ability for the television channels to provide several programs at once.  to receive the digital cable you must have a television with a ditial tuner, have a cable or satellite provider with a digital signal, or buy an analog to digital converter box.  The industry and the government are making attempts to not leave viewers behind in the switch by issuing $40 coupons to viewers (two per household).  The industry and the government are making attempts to educate the public about the switch through various media outlets.  There are several television and radio commericals, internet information, and print media coverage. 
http://www.heartland.org/policybot/results.html?articleid=23368

It is a fact that the switch from analog to digital is for the use of the valued airwaves for wireless services.  Many critics believe that this whole switch is for the money involved in the selling of the bandwidth ranges.  This article above discusses what some of the critics are saying about the switch.  Some critics say that the switch is mainly for the broadcasters benefit.  The broadcasters counter this by saying that it isn&apos;t only for their benefit, and that the switch is actually costing them alot of money.  Another big criticism of the switch is that the public shouldn&apos;t have to pay for the switch.  Many viewers already have television capable of digital tuning, but the others will have to buy a new television or converter box.  Although the government did issue coupons, converter boxes will ranger from around $40-$75.  The coupon should most if not all of the cost.  But, the people who will buy new televisions will pay the most money.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 12'/><attribute name='message_id' value='68958'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 12'/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 15:26:29'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227299189'/><attribute name='author' value='Sierra Henton'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='It is estimated that 36 million people who now only get free television with an aerial will be affected by the switch to digital TV in February, 2009.

The industry has been using a few different techniques to make sure that people aren&amp;rsquo;t disenfranchised in any way.  There have been commercials regarding the switch from analog to digital for over a year now. This has given many people a chance to have time to purchase a digital box.   There has also been a coupon program made that allows a total of two per house hold  forty dollar off  coupons to be used for purchasing a DTV box.

The article I found is from the official DTV website.  The site states that it will in fact offer better picture and sound quality. But I also personally think it has something to do with making money from bandwidth ranges.

Technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations because there is and will always be advancements in technology. In order for companies to make money, they have to keep up with technological advancements.

A large amount of time and money is being put into commercial advertising and newspaper ad. Almost all major cable companies have had some sort of information about the transition to digital TV following their commercials. The government has put out numerous radio and TV ads informing the public. Also a website was made to give the public an in-depth overview of the transition. This is the website: http://www.dtv.gov/consumercorner.html. The government is also giving out capons to help the public buy the converter box.
 
 
How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?
 
Both the government a cable companies have spent a lot of money in informing the public. You can find information about the transition on websites, TV, radio, and mail. The government has used the public airways as a way to let the mass public know the switch. Almost on every form of communications public and private there is information about the switch. To get a more in depth view about the transition the government has created a public website to look at.

This switch will allow the electronic and cable industries to profit in the billions. With out a doubt some people will be sitting on a mountain of cash come February. What people don&amp;rsquo;t realize is how the rest of the world will be affected by his switch, especially third world countries. America will sell all these along TVs to third world countries come time for the switch. These TVs will end up in massive dumps. This will result in massive landfill of toxic. The TVs will spill toxic from sitting so long that will cause a harmful environment for the citizens. Broadcast television travels through the air, while cable travels through wire. Now some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331040,00.html'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: week12 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='68499'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: week12 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='20-11-08 10:00:30'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227193230'/><attribute name='author' value='Echo Kiser'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Your last point about the landfill is great.

The industry  has worked to make sure people not disenfranchised, by continuously promoting, and marking digital television. Its always marketing how much better digital television and how it will change the way we watch t.v. overall.  I think the government and industry have promoted digital television well, because the support of the government.

I agree that  it is more costly to sell the bandwidth ranges, technology has a huge influence on the way the industry  decisions are made. Technology has been able to increase the quality of watching television at a pretty reasonable price.  Also, the industry has the ability to grow and expand with the various options that comes with the advancement of television.

http://www.antennaweb.org/aw/welcome.aspx
This is a site for people getting over the air (OTA) broadcasts. It shows them where the OTA stations are located in relation to their house and how they should direct their antennas for best reception. It is quite useful especially for people who get marginal reception. The industry is trying to give people as much warning as possible as well as the necessary steps to have a problem free transition. I have seen many commercials on broadcast and also cable channels explain what is happening.

Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6695/is_/ai_n26420993
This site is talking about the vacated analog TV frequencies in Europe. It is saying how much money it is worth. I am sure the same can be applied to the situation here in the United States. I do not think that the amount money the frequencies are worth is the driving factor behind the transition to digital TV. Although it is definitely a benefit for some, I think the United States switching to digital TV is partly because we need to keep up with the rest of the world. The transition is not just happening in the United States but all over the world. The picture quality is the biggest benefit for customers. 

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.
Cable companies actually benefit from the transition. They get the reassure all their customers that nothing is changing for them. For many people change is not easy, so the fact the cable companies are stopping any change from happening for their customers, makes their customers feel a lot more confident in their cable provider. Broadcast companies get much more flexibility in there broadcasts and what they can do. For example, channel 7 has a regular ABC channel and a 24-hour weather channel on digital TV.
Earlier this year I bought a HDTV turner card for my PC. To receive HD programming I had to figure out the digital OTA broadcasts. I needed to buy an OTA antenna and figure out how to position it to get the best reception. So I have had digital OTA programming for a while. There are a lot more digital OTA channels then analog, and the quality is excellent. There is no snow either I get prefect reception or nothing. I love it I use my computer as a DVR. I had to work during the UofM and OSU game so I was not able to see it. I recorded it in HD OTA. I know the outcome of the game so I am in no rush to watch it, but the quality is simply amazing. Just a side note 4 hours of HD programming uses 23GB on my hard drive.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Going Digital'/><attribute name='message_id' value='69051'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Going Digital'/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 23:22:04'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227327724'/><attribute name='author' value='Erika Phillips'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='It is estimated that 36 million people who now only get free television with an aerial 

will be affected by the switch to digital TV in February, 2009. How is the industry worked

educate the public about the switch to digital television?

(link to information) http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html

To answer these questions, I went to the Federal Communications Commission website (FCC). 

Here it shows all firsthand information consumers want to know about the big change 

happening to television in February 2009. According to the site, industry has worked to 

prevent disenfranchisement by providing two $40 coupons upon request to any U.S. household 

between January 1, 2008, and March 31, 2009, to be used toward the future purchase of 

eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes.With converter boxes, the households that have 

analog television set can receive and view over-the-air digital programming.

I have not been watching television much lately, but about a year ago, I noticed the many 

commercials announcincing the switch to digital this coming February. This allowed 

industry and government to spread the word very quickly. What better way to advertise the 

change than have it come directly out of the product being changed? I believe this was a 

very good marketing technique to reach millions.

Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not 

better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth 

ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications 

corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.

(link to information) http://reviews.cnet.com/dtv-transition/

Ultimately, I do agree that virtually all of what changed in industry is to maximize 

profits, but at least they are providing help for the many who cannot afford new tv&apos;s 

through the coupons. Unfortunately, I have not come across a single person who has receive 

the coupons, nor have I heard about it until researching this assignment. Reviews by Cnet 

show both sides of the argument. On the denial side, government has been trying to push 

this to happen for more than ten years, to open up analog for emergency broadcasts. In 

addition, digital is better quality.

But to help on the confirming side of this argument, the government would make $19.6 

billion for this transition. In my opinion, I think big name tv manufactureres had some 

pull in this change as well because they saw the profit in making consumers feel they had 

no choice but to buy a more expensive digital tv. That pressure was quite strong even with 

people around me, until the converter box was announced.

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast 

television organizations.

Whenever new innovative technology is released, it usually becomes the &apos;must have&apos; thing 

for consumers. The cable and broasdcast televisions must keep up with the trend if they 

want to stay on the profit-making spectrum of business. We have gotten so

accustomed to so many technologies introduced that many of us don&apos;t remember what it was

like before they existed.

The FCC has teamed up with retail stores to provide vouchers to consumers so that they can be prepared for the digital transition. Consumers are able to contact a toll free 800# or access the information online so that they can receive 2 $40 off coupons to purchase a digital converter box. The government has also broadcasted numerous PSA&apos;s and advertisements to educate and make aware the public and this transition and how they can be effected. The effects are that all television that receives over the air broadcasts will be &apos;left in the dark&apos; as broadcast stations and networks are switching over to digital technology. With this transition all programming will be digital versus analog. All non digital televisions will be required to have the converter box which allows it to receive the digital frequencies.

1.       The industry is making sure that people who have free cable are not without television through this transition by handing out coupons that save $40 on the purchase of a cable box. The boxes only run $50-60 so they are being very generous. The industry and government are working together by producing many commercials and advertisements about the switch. They began these ads way in advance as well to let the public know ahead of time. 
 
2.       http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/Why-Are-We-Switching-to-Digital-Television-Signals-.id-6025.html I am not completely sold on the idea of the clear picture or freeing space for other uses, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put it past the industry to want to make more money by selling the available bandwidth. The article I have chosen does state that the industry will be saving money because they will no longer have to spend the money between analog cable and digital cable they can just spend it solely on digital.
 
3.       Technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations because they have to stay apart of the new and improved ways. If these companies do not stay in tune with the new technology then they will go out of business.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think this switch is completely necessary for the cable companies to stay in business and I personally believe it is just a choice to make more money.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 12 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='68583'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 12 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='20-11-08 13:49:52'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227206992'/><attribute name='author' value='Lauren Madison'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree with your #3...

I think that the industry and government have done a great job of educating the public about the switch to digital television.

Honestly, I agree with the experts. I think that while a better picture quality will be nice for everyone, the real motivation here is in fact the money aspect. I did have trouble trying to find articles confirming this argument though! Dtv.gov also states that the reason for the switch is in order to free up the broadcast spectrum for the public safety communications. I can see how this switch will be beneficial to them.  
The article I did find discusses the switchover in depth and brings up some interesting points:

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.

Since technology has allowed us to be able to make this switch I think that it is an easy, clear cut decision for the cable and broadcast television organizations to make.

It is estimated that 36 million people who now only get free television with an aerial will be affected by the switch to digital TV in February, 2009. How is the industry worked to make sure people are not disenfranchised? How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?

     The industry worked out a solution in vouchers to prevent people from being disenfranchised. These vouchers are being distributed by the Government via our tax dollars to make sure everyone is equally treated for this &apos;switch-over&apos;. These vouchers are an equivalence of $40, so that the people who can not afford these digital tuners can purchase them. However the government has made it so that ANYONE can request these vouchers, which in my opnion defeats the purpose of the voucher. I guess our increase in tax dollars may finally be benefeiting us. The industry and the government are both sending out commercials and flyers that are being received by almost every home. I used to work for Comcast and we were informing people of this back in 2006-2007 about the switch for 2009. We, as technicians, were told to calm the customer and let them know that all of their troubles were covered by us, since they were not using an &apos;over-the-air&apos; tuner. 

Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.

     I personally believe it is a mixture of both. Switching to digital will provide better picture quality as well as removing any issues one may have had with signal strength and static in the past. Digital has to meet a certain strength for it to even show the picture; so in other words you either see [100% of] a picture or you don&apos;t see any picture at all (since a digital tuner will display a blank screen if the signal is not strong enough). Personally after reading more and more about the switch on my own, I think it has to do with the efficiency of the use of the bandwidth as opposed to the pure profit gains. However, it is a mixture of both. Money drives the world, and when you can get money for &apos;space&apos; you do it. That space though, will open up the effieciency in broadcasting, allowing better flow of the &apos;information&apos; broadcast upon it.

The industry is making sure that people don&apos;t get disinfranchised by keeping everyone up to date on the advancements of digital television.  People have known about this switch for over a year now, so they&apos;ve had time to prepare.  There have been many commercials and advertisments informing us about the switch and that only certain TVs will work after February 17, 2009.  Just as any appliance, a TV needs to be replaced from time to time.  Since we&apos;ve had so much time to go out and buy a new TV that will support the features of digital television, no one should feel disenfranchised when the switch happens.

Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations.

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.

I read that depending on the service people have, it may take a while to load each channel when surfing.  This may encourage some organizations to limit the amount of pictures or characters they use in the &apos;info&apos; field that pops up when a channel comes on so that it comes up quicker for more timely channel surfing.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 12 Assignment '/><attribute name='message_id' value='69370'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 12 Assignment '/><attribute name='message_date' value='23-11-08 21:42:36'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227494556'/><attribute name='author' value='La Rhonda Lewis'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='If this process will take things longer to load onto your television set, is that not a step backwards?

The industry as well as the government have taken steps to ensure that people are aware of the situation and are prepared.  One way that people are becoming aware of the switch is through TV ads.  Commercials explaining what will occur and what needs to be done in order for their sets to continue to work.

Another way is through different websites that people can go to that explains the switch, and explains the difference between digital and analog.  The government is also providing coupons to people who qualify to help them afford the purchase of converter boxes.  this in itself prevents people from becoming disenfranchised by saying that digital tv isn&apos;t only meant for people who can afford expensive high def tv sets.

In regards to the argument regarding the motivation for the switch to digital, I can see both sides. I do believe digital is better and as technology evolves, the masses should be able to enjoy the advancements.  Although, I don&apos;t think that the switch is necessary and people shouldn&apos;t have to be forced to switch so in that sense it can really be about money.  When you think about other advancements that have occurred, people have not been forced to use them. In this sense, we really do not have a choice.

How is the industry worked to make sure people are not disenfranchised? How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?

For people who still receive a T.V. signal via antenna, they will still be able to get their free T.V.  The industry has created several different kinds of digital to analog converters.  The government has issued (to people who have applied) a $40 coupon that is eligible to be used when buying one of these converters.  Both the industry and government have created websites that will educate people as to what they need to do in order to prepare for the switch.

Question 2
Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.

It is true that although the picture will be of better quality, the true reason for the switch is because of the bandwidth ranges.  As an electrical engineer I took a class last winter call &apos;Analog and Digital Communications&apos;.  One of the topics discussed in the class was the switch.  A lot of the frequencies will be allocated to be used by the military and others will be sold to major corporations for use.  

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.

As technology advances it forces these organizations to advance as well.  If they do not than they will be left behind.  People always want the newest technology available and if one organization makes this technology available then the others must in order to keep up with the changing world.  

As a side note, I thought that it was kind of interesting as to why Feb 17 was used as the switch over date.  They wanted to do it at the beginning of the month but waited until the 17th because of the most popular television event of the year, the Superbowl occurs at the begining of Feb and if there were a problem with the switch and people didnt get to watch it there would be mass hysteria.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Digital TV '/><attribute name='message_id' value='68437'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Digital TV '/><attribute name='message_date' value='19-11-08 22:54:42'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227153282'/><attribute name='author' value='Roberto Morales'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value=' I didn&apos;t know about the Feb 17th date was because of the Super Bowl, but it makes sense.

The industry and government have gone to great lengths to inform the general public about the analog to digital conversion. They have provided people with all the necessary information in many different forms. There is a toll free number one can call. There is the website and there have been various forums held at places such as local public libraries where questions can be answered by representatives. 

Simply put, anything that can drive the costs that are already being incurred heavily by the customer upwards is what drives the decisions made by cable/broadcast organizations.

Below is an article I found on MSNBC confirming that true motivation for the switch to digital is greed (profits) as opposed to picture quality.

They can add digital cable service for as little as $29.99. This would include over 100 channels including ON DEMAND. They also have other offers to make this transition easier for the residents who are going to be affected which include giving 2 free Digital boxes to people who have basic cable now. The government is also offering free boxes taht are compatible with our cable service to people who are eligible to recieve them due to lower income.
http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=822
The industry is educating people by sending notices in the mail prior to the transition as well as advertising on cable television. They are also informing their employees to  inform all customers who call in and/or come into office. Myself as well as the company&apos;s 100,000 employees were required to take a digital migration tutorial that informed us on the migration and we were tested afterwards to make sure we understand the way the migration will work so we can correctly inform our clients and customers.
Money always plays a role in everything that Big Business does, but coming from a first hand witness, the digital migration will enhance the picture quality that analog signal is currently offering its customers.  Not to mention that analog is one of the oldest forms of technology that has not yet been updated and with all the advancements taht has evolved with technolgy such as DISH and U Verse systems, its about time analog picture quality is upgraded.

How is the industry worked to make sure people are not disenfranchised?
The industry is making sure people are not disenfranchised by public service announcements, by TV and radio advertisements. A lot of detail planning has gone into making sure the people are informed right down to when are the best times to advertise on TV and on the Radio. Articles are also placed in newspapers for their subscribers to read. I&amp;rsquo;ve even received an announcement in my Cable bill informing me about the change to digital TV in February 2009. It went on to tell me that as long as I have cable I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about losing my signal even if I don&amp;rsquo;t have a digital TV. I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen some advertisements about the change from analog to digital television posted in the electronics department in some retail stores.

How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?
The ncta, National Cable and Telecommunications Association have been. From eight founding members in February 2007, the DTV Transition Coalition has grown to 240 members representing the federal government and a variety of consumer groups, broadcast, cable and consumer companies, retailers, civil rights and grassroots organizations, trade associations and state and local government organizations. Members of the Coalition are reaching out directly to communities affected by the transition with educational materials, speaking engagements and other grassroots initiatives.

Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations.
Find information to confirm or deny this argument.
I don&amp;rsquo;t believe money is the motivation for the switch, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s more of the changing of times and technology. One can&amp;rsquo;t argue the fact that digital television has a better picture quality than analog.

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.
Technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations because technology is always advancing day by day. So, in order for cable and broadcast television to keep up with the changing times they have to continue to advance right along with Technology or they&amp;rsquo;re company could fail. For example: The analog television. Even though people may not see it yet, everyone is eventually going to have to buy a digital television; it&amp;rsquo;s just going to be the thing to have. It&amp;rsquo;s like running water, we need to have it.  Can you imagine living in the year of 2050 with an analog television; somebody might have you committed to a mental hospital.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 12...Cable and Broadcast Television  '/><attribute name='message_id' value='68963'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 12...Cable and Broadcast Television  '/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 15:38:29'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227299909'/><attribute name='author' value='Sarah Wegener'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Hi Michelle!

The industry has done many things to make sure that people are not disenfranchised one of which is to heavily advertise on local television channels. The link below is an example of one of the commercials used on a local channel 7. Although some people are against making such transition into government law, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to do so. There is huge number of people who still receive analog TV signals around 70 million. If the government does not mandate such transaction it won&amp;rsquo;t happen.

How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?
 
By making the switch to digital TV mandatory the government now has the responsibility to educate the public on this issue. In addition to heavily advertising on many television channels the government has put together a website that has all the information on this transition.

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations
 
Technology has certainly come a long way especially that of media technology. This past week I was channel surfing when I came across a really old black and white movie. I could not believe what I was watching, the motions of the actors was extremely slow, there was no audio and the only dialogue was one that was written on the screen between scenes. This old film made me think about were the technology was taken us and where will we be in 5 or 10 years. As new technology is made available broadcasting companies have to &apos;upgrade&amp;rdquo; in order to draw consumers to them. 

The idea of recording 4 shows at once or watching in HD weren&amp;rsquo;t options that we had a few years ago however now it&amp;rsquo;s hard to live without them. I think that broadcasting companies have no choice but to respond to these technological advancements.

I thought this article was interesting because it quotes the CEO&amp;rsquo;s of the big 3, of the electronics industry: Circuit City, Best Buy and Target. All of the men seem to have been (in January 2008, when the article was written) worried about how consumers would react to the change. Nervousness is the best way to describe the companies&amp;rsquo; feelings at the time this article was written. They were feeling as though there was going to be tremendous pressure for their stores to supply the some 14.3 million households that still use the bunny ears. I thought this article was interesting and related to the class well because it was coming from the view point of the companies that one would think would be happy because they will be making money on the conversion. The companies were all very crediting to the government who is making sure that the world is getting out, anyone who does not know about this conversion yet, probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t watch television anyway!! There have been so many commercials, articles, and news segments dedicated to this conversion, and the talks have been happening for over a year, so the education of consumers is defiantly available. Radio Shack, in fact, had a whole day dedicated to demonstrating and explaining what exactly the change will entail.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: The opinion of the electronics stores.

The industry has put out commercials that talk about the switch to DTV in February 2009.  It has been on almost every channel but mainly on the &apos;over the air&apos; channels.  Commercials and radio ads are the way to educate the general public.  There may be ads in the paper but I do not pick up a paper.  I will occasionally read the paper online but I don&apos;t see any ads there.

This site talks about what channels you can fit in the 6Mhz carrier frequency.  It mentions how more HDTV channel and digital channels can fit into 1 analog channel.  I think some of this is being driven from within because they want to advance technology.  I do not think there is going to be money made hand over fist.  Can you go and buy a 500 Mhz computer?  Nope.  I think as the technology advances the old had to go out and the new has to go in.  Maybe a better example is single vs dual/quad core processors.  Can you buy many single core processors anymore?  They are not nearly as prevelant.

Technology drives any decision because people always seem to want the newest and best there is to offer.  Money is definitly a driving factor too but I do not think that money is the main driving factor in this changeover to Digital television.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Analog to Digital Transition '/><attribute name='message_id' value='69048'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Analog to Digital Transition '/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 23:14:50'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227327290'/><attribute name='author' value='Michelle Slater'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Hi Matthew,

Question 1:  How is the industry worked to make sure people are not disenfranchised?
By informing people of what is about to come and by having coupons ($40) for the converter boxes so consumers would receive some type of discount. The government wants to make sure that everyone knows what DTV is and how to wants to make sure that consumers are ready for the switch. 
 
How is the industry and government working to educate the public about the switch to digital television?
 
There have been ads all over that are letting people know about the change to digital television. I know that they have at least given people a year warning that it was going to happen so they can prepare themselves for February. There are many sites on the internet that gives information regarding what consumers need to know about the switch. It is a pretty big deal and the government wants everyone informed that people will be effected by the switch if they don&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it. 
 
Some experts believe that the true motivation for the switch to digital television is not better picture quality, but the huge amounts of money involved in selling the bandwidth ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcasts to large communications corporations. Find information to confirm or deny this argument.
 
According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the reasoning behind the switch to digital is so that consumers can benefit because digital broadcasting allows stations to offer improved picture and sound quality, and digital is much more efficient than analog. The FCC states that rather than being limited to providing one analog program, a broadcaster is able to offer a super sharp &apos;high definition&amp;rdquo; (HD) digital program or multiple &apos;standard definition&amp;rdquo; (SD) digital programs simultaneously through a process called &apos;multicasting.&amp;rdquo; Multicasting allows broadcast stations to offer several channels of digital programming at the same time, using the same amount of spectrum required for one analog program. 
FCC doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention anything about the money aspect of selling the bandwidth ranges that currently occupy analog television.

Discuss briefly how the technology drives the decisions made by cable and broadcast television organizations.
 
Technology is a big driving force for big decisions such as the switch to digital television. With new technology advancements supposedly comes a new, bigger, and better thing. Consumers tend to always want something bigger and better and especially when it comes to television, consumers like the idea of a clear, high-definition sort of picture. Advancing the quality of television is probably something that many people want.

You are so right when you wrote &apos;consumers like the idea of a clear, high-definition sort of picture.

The industry and government are making this switch by providing a website to learn more, on tv commercials today. They are broadcasting this new change all over televison and quickly explaining what will happen and if you do not have digital converter right now, what you need to do coming up. They also are providing some kind of tax break to those who will need to make the change before it happens. Unfortunatly, those unaware of the switch are &quot;digitally challenged.&quot; For example the older generation will not know how to handle this change. Also, they are not willing to visit a website because they do not own a computer or are not knowledgable of its services. 

The switch cannot be about picture quality, most corporations rely on simple changes to gain free publicity and gain more money. This is just another justification for companies to charge more because your getting &quot;better picture quality&quot;. Raising prices is justified just by the give and take by these corporations. Technology drives decisions made because the faster companies can put out their service the more money they can make by justifiying it. If one company claims their speed and picture quality is faster then most of the business will go to them. Prices betweens these companies are also very similar so the competition isnt there. Most people are choosing between two services. Also, most homes do have cable and it is just an essential right along with water, companies are aware of this so they pretty much dictate their prices.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Digital TV '/><attribute name='message_id' value='68457'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Digital TV '/><attribute name='message_date' value='20-11-08 00:07:20'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227157640'/><attribute name='author' value='Richard Lathers'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree that many of the elderly and will have a difficult transition.

These converter boxes are not that expensive.  I got a &apos;voucher&apos; from the government for $40.  I went to BestBuy and got a converter box for $60.  If the elderly can not afford $20 then they are in more serious trouble.  Yes our taxes are paying for the vouchers but the way I look at it, we would have paid that out of our pocket either way.  Also, if people can&apos;t spare the $20, we have known about this for more than a year so saving a dollar a month would almost get you the extra money.  I think the cost of this converter box is a good price and it does not put the strain on a house that can not afford cable or satellite.

Where there is competition, money is going to be a big issue and it will very interesting to see how people will adjust to this change.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='68349'/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Digital Television/Analog'/><attribute name='message_id' value='68786'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Digital Television/Analog'/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 00:36:28'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227245788'/><attribute name='author' value='Christina Ponder'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='https://www.dtv2009.gov/

The industry and the government have basically teamed up to educate the public about the switch from analog to digital television. There are commercial broadcasts about the switch that have been airing since this time last year and the government are offering free cupons for a converter device for those people who need to make the switch. There is a phone number people can call as well as a website (listed above) where people can get more information. On the website there is a countdown for when the switch will happen as well as an easy to follow promotion campaign for people: Apply (for a coupon), Buy (a converter box) and Try!. The campaign is being promoted to look simple so people do not feel overwhelmed by the switch and the whole process is being advertised as taking 6 weeks. 

This article does not have to do with better picture quality. I think it&apos;s crazy, so I couldn&apos;t pass it up: http://thetruthandlight.wordpress.com/2008/11/08/the-real-reason-behind-the-switch-from-analog-to-digital/
The whole article talks about how there is a whole &apos;new world order&apos; and the switch to digital is all part of the movement. The article does not think that the government wants money because they are passing out millions of coupons to make the switch easy and affordable for people. The article DOES say the switch is being made to spy on people in their homes. I think it&apos;s funny. It reminds me a little of Montag/Farenheit 451 or something with censorship and the government involvement. 

New technology is usually always beneficial to companies like Comcast because it allows them to offer more services and make more profit. New technology can help drive competition and I think cable/broadcast television organizations thrive on it. This is why it has a great influence on the decisions made by companies like Comcast.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Digital Television/Analog '/><attribute name='message_id' value='69329'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Digital Television/Analog '/><attribute name='message_date' value='23-11-08 19:36:19'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227486979'/><attribute name='author' value='Heba Abouarabi'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I never read anything on a &apos;new world order&apos;, but it&apos;s definetly an interesting take on the issue.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='68786'/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Funny - no tv for old people in 2009!'/><attribute name='message_id' value='69049'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Funny - no tv for old people in 2009!'/><attribute name='message_date' value='21-11-08 23:15:51'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227327351'/><attribute name='author' value='Catherine Siebert'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='http://www.hulu.com/watch/36608/talkshow-with-spike-feresten-cable-psa

There are many things that the industry is doing to make sure that people are not disenfranchised. Above I included a link to a government run website that gives people information on the switch. On this website there is tons of information about the switch to digital tv and also some coupons and rebates to make the new equipment needed more affordable.

I agree that the switch to digital television is all about selling bandwiths. They are going to make billions of dollars selling these frequencies. While doing this they have the perfect cover of picture quality. While the switch will allow cable companies to focus on the best technology, there is a lot of money motivation to make this law happen.

As mentioned above, I don&apos;t believe that technology is the only factor driving this decision. Money is the main factor, and if the companies can make more money by pushing technology onto people, this is what they will do. While this is true, better technology allows cable companies to be more efficient and hopefully be able to pass costs savings on to their customers.

They have done so by giving early warnings and people ample amount of time to make the switch, as well as the industry working with the media and complanies to get people better acquainted and accustomed to the digital world by making everything that we use on a daily basis digital, such as our cell phones,home phones, music players, computers and even newest television sets! These are all sources that people are forced to use daily as a means of communication and keeping in touch with the rest of the world. The industry and the government has worked closely to educate the public about the switch to digital television through these means, by getting people and society as a whole acquainted and more familiar with the digital technological world as well as by advertising the major pros of using digital technology.
    Indeed a common argument in favor of using digital television is better picture quality, and also one could argue that huge amounts of money will be spent in selling the bandwith ranges that are currently occupied by analog television broadcast to large communications coporations. However, upon researching this issue, although a lot of money could be involved, which is an issue that did seem present in many research articles, the money however will be well worth it because the purpose the switch is due to the fact that having digital television will free up parts of the broadcast spectrum for public safety communications such as the police and fire departments as well as provide for more advanced wireless services such as better cell phone networks and airwaves. In saving money however, it will also allow for multicasting which will allow broadcast stations to offer several channels of digital programming at the same time which could potentially save money! also, more programming choices for viewers. The major set back however for this switch is that the digital airwaves are more sensitive to weather and are easily disrupted in thunderstorms and heavy rain. 
    This technological change drives the decisions made by cable and broadast television organizations for many reasons. First off, how much data it can transmit is an issue with digital having more of a capacity for larger amounts of data. Also how consistent the data stays over the distance it needs to travel. What type of data the signal can carry. All in all for the same amount of bandwidth you can fit a lot more information into a digital signal than an analog one. 
    
The link provides a picture for a clear indication of the how much more technologically advanced we are becoming nowadays. Its also sends the message of &apos;out with the old, in with the new&apos;. Setting the clear distinction to encourage consumers to keep up with the joneses!

After examining several sources on the web; it appears that there is a lot of fear the Cable and Satellite companies will take advantage of the changeover.   However, being that people are aware of this a lot is being done to prevent people from being taken advantage of.  
http://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSTRE4AH71B20081118
The article above talks about how the FCC is enforcing strict fines for business that take advantage of the changeover by raising prices or misinforming customers.   There seemed to be a lot of articles stressing fines and actions that the FCC is taking to make sure people are not taken advantage of during the changeover.  
http://ozarksfirst.com/content/fulltext/?cid=86681
This article talks about who really needs a converter box and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t .  Lots of news channels are doing what they can to make sure people are aware.  I notice that on all publically broadcast channels there are commercials to make people aware of the changeover and inform them.  All these are examples of the industry is working to make sure people are not disenfranchised  and that they are educated about the changeover.
The true motivation for the switch was harder to find information.  Mostly there were articles about who needs a convertor box and steps the FCC is taking to ensure people are not taken advantage of.  I did however find an interesting comment on Wikipedia. &apos;The motivation behind the switch is the improved quality of digital broadcasts over analogue ones, adding digital subchannels, the freeing-up of valuable radio spectrum space for other services, and to bring in large amounts of money at spectrum auctions.&amp;rdquo; While the validity of the statement is questionable, but the opinion of it is still interesting.  It seems there are those out there who feel the main motivation behind the switch has to do with money.  My personal opinion is that it has more to do with the technology behind television keeping up with the rest of the growing communications world, such as the internet.  While some feel that is part of the motivation, most are more fearful and are quicker to side with the idea that money is the main motivation for the changeover.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Changeover '/><attribute name='message_id' value='69078'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Changeover '/><attribute name='message_date' value='22-11-08 11:20:02'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227370802'/><attribute name='author' value='Kristine McCurry'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='25027'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='309969'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I was unaware that the FCC is going to implement fines to any company which raises their prices or misinforms customers of the change over.

I found this video on &apos;youtube&amp;rdquo; and thought it was appropriate for our discussion. Although I would not perform the acts made by the man in video, I respect his right to do so.  Desecration of the American flag by burning is a particularly provocative insult.  In a country that prides itself on freedom of speech, flag-burning is meant to test that freedom to its limits. There is currently nothing in the Constitution&apos;s definition of freedom of expression that expressly declares flag-burning illegal.  Over twenty years ago, Congress passed the &apos;Flag Protection Act&amp;rdquo; which imposed a federal ban on flag desecration. However, the act was later struck down by the Supreme Court. 
I also thought that the Presidential election was a historical event. I believed that both candidates were great leaders and either one would improve our current situation. I thought that McCain was running uphill from the beginning because he was constantly labeled as Bush II. I think that it would be great if the next president was a female. 
Question 2: Is Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media climate? Did you see any broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain and Obama?
I believe that Section 315 is appropriate in today&amp;rsquo;s media. I did not agree with the law when I initially read the Act, but after reading the text book, I changed my opinion. Like the text states, the equal opportunity law provides forums for lesser-known and less-wealthy candidates that represent different views than the Republican and Democratic parties. 
I did not see many broadcasts or articles on my preferred candidate Ron Paul. I had to search in depth for information on Paul. I think that if he was of the Republican or Democratic party he would have more coverage.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Freedom of Expression '/><attribute name='message_id' value='65748'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Freedom of Expression '/><attribute name='message_date' value='12-11-08 12:31:33'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226511093'/><attribute name='author' value='Emmad Awaad'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='It is not an honorable act to burn down any countries flag, especially the on you live in. however, this shows the vest freedoms of speech that Americans have.

The video is a visual example of Freedom of Speech here in the United States. The director begins with a Sesame   Street themed introduction to obtain the viewers attention and includes comical suggestions of freedom of speech. Although the video is funny yet it portrays a perfect example of Freedom of Speech and how what we say effects those around us. There are some exceptions to the rule as brought out in the First Amendment that slander, libel, racism, and many other forms of speech that would cause harm it the people are against Federal, State, and/or Local Governments
 
Here in the United   States, we have the gift of the First Amendment unlike other countries who are imprisoned if not killed for voicing their opinions. I truly believe in the scriptural reference that &apos;the power lies within the tongue&apos; and that what we say can have either a positive of negative effect on ourselves and those who listen. Each and every day I try to think and speak positive things so that the day will be filled with positive light. &apos;If you thinketh so shall it be&apos; and &apos;if you sayeth it shall come to pass&apos;&amp;hellip;some of my own words of wisdom that I recite to myself to help me stay on the straight and narrow even when the day can be so hard on me.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Freedom of Speech'/><attribute name='message_id' value='66506'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Freedom of Speech'/><attribute name='message_date' value='14-11-08 12:13:24'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226682804'/><attribute name='author' value='Roberto Morales'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value=' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgrtHQ93L1g
1-A. I chose this clip because I believe that Bill Maher is one of the most outspoken talk show hosts in the United States and always takes his right of freedom of speech to the limit.  On this particular interview with Bill O&amp;rsquo;Reilly who is host on our most conservative channel Fox news invited Maher to talk about why CBS news did not allow him to present his views on religion.  Bill brought up a point about how US Christians are hypocritical and pick and chose what part of religion they want to use, he used the term &apos;Cafeteria Christians&amp;rdquo;.  He also mentions that we don not have to hide behind religion to treat other with respect and to give to charity.  O&amp;rsquo;Reilly being very &apos;conservative&amp;rdquo; interrupted Maher during most of the interview and questioned how many times President Bush was going to be bashed during the interview.
1-B. The election of Obama as President really changes the way we are seen around the world.  Our current president George W. Bush has really left a black eye on our reputation around the world and the way we are treated by other countries, we are consider bullies of the world.  Our attack and the creation of the Iraq war was sold to us as a quick deployment and a quick fix, it has gone on for 6 years and counting.  The way our president justify our attack in Iraq was Saddam Hussein&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Al Qaeda and the production of Weapons of Mass Destruction that really never materialize. I believe that Obama being an African American and really breaking the standard of a US president will benefit us in our international relationships. 
2-A. 
Section 315 is relevant to today&amp;rsquo;s political campaigns, but it is not what we had.  Every time we looked at the campaign trails on TV all we got was McCain and Obama.  As it often happens mainstream media promotes the majority and leaves others in the shadows.  For that reason is very hard for an independent candidate to gain enough votes to become president or to even get enough votes to be noticed. http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/

Hi Roberto,  

I don&apos;t know if I should but I really feel sorry for George W. Bush.  He has messed up America&apos;s reputation.  Although it probably wasn&apos;t all that good in the beginning he has destroyed a country until it is almost unrepairable.  My prayers are with him, I can&apos;t imagine how he must feel.  He wasn&apos;t even wanted at the Republican convention, that had to hurt him.  I feel so bad for him and his family.  His father&apos;s legacy has gone down the drain.  My Prayers are with the Obama family as well.  Barack truly has alot of mess to clean up.

This blog article actually discusses Internet censorship in China. After the media buzz 
during Olympics in Beijing, a lot of censorship occurred. Freedom of speech has been 
slashed at tremendously in China. It is almost impossible to extend one&apos;s opinion to the 
public. The reason I chose this article was because it was written by Ling Tzu Wang, a 
first generation Chinese American who is freely expressing his opinions on Chinese 
government on an American blog... which is why it isn&apos;t censored.

Exercise your freedom of speech! Include your own thoughts on the results of the recent 

election., in 100 words or more.

Exercising my freedom of speech, my personal views on politics are very neutral as far as 
siding with candidates in their efforts to &apos;make America better&apos;. I do not believe the 
words and promises of man, but rather their actions and results. Furthermore, I try my 
utmost to stay out of politics because I know that at a future set time, God will 
establish a heavenly government to rule over the earth. So I am kind of indifferent to the 
election results either way. But I do, at the same time, stay abreast as to what is going 
on around me so I can be an informed individual, which is why despite my neutrality, I do 
know what is going on in the elections. Based on the results, I DO think it is a very 
HISTORIC election, mainly because of the obvious; Obama is the first African American to 
become president. I thought of how ironic is was that 50 years ago, a BLACK person would 
be hung on a noose for even expressing even the thought of such (Jim Crow laws). I also 
realize something that can turn into a very controversial topic: Obama is not BLACK, he&apos;s 
Kenyan (African) and White (American), born in Hawaii; Grade-schooled in Asia, raised by 
his white family, educated in Harvard, and eventually moved to Chicago. In addition, his 
family does not have slavery roots that depleted his family origins and was never really 
raised as a black American, so it seems kind of ironic to me that the majority of blacks 
and hispanics, in reality, voted for him based on the fact that they could &apos;relate&apos; 
(racewise), which is in fact, racist itself. See what I mean? Human politics are complex 
and faulty, which is why I do not put my trust in them.

than McCain and Obama? Post an example link if available.

I do not think that here in the U.S., the objective of this act has been successful. The 
saying &apos;Money makes the world go around&apos; proves true because &apos;poorly funded third-party 
candidates&apos; are much less broadcasted to the general public. In fact, I think that the 
average American wasn&apos;t even aware of the other presidential candidates this year until 
they saw their names on the ballots 
(See http://vote-mi.org/BallotCandidates.aspx?Election=20081104GMI000000ALL). 
This link shows that Cynthia Mckinney, Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin, and Ralph Nader 
were all minor party candidates.

To me, freedom of speech is the flexibility to express yourself in any way, shape, or form. One&amp;rsquo;s freedom of speech does not allow them to interfere with anyone else&amp;rsquo;s freedom of speech. In this video, a soldier is expressing himself on YouTube concerning what he thinks before the election. He supports McCain but addresses Obama. He is well spoken yet respectful and he practicing his freedom of speech.  As a soldier who experienced many things overseas, there is some value to what he is saying. Anyone can express themselves on YouTube, but the way in which this guy did it created a lot of buzz.

Well I voted for McCain, so the election did not finish how I would have liked, but it was a good experience. Although I have voted every year since I turned 18 this was my first chance to vote for president. My dad took me to vote and the lines were not long at my precinct. I am looking forward to the next few years no matter who won the presidential election. I am watching now to see if the democrats will get 60 seats in senate. If they do, that would worry me because then the republicans cannot use a filibuster. Without the filibuster being in the way of the democrats, the democrats will have far too much flexibility running the government in my mind.
 
On a side note last semester, I had Comm 331 with Professor Kiska. The class was Online Research, Writing and Reporting. He showed us how he did exit polls. I am now fairly familiar with SPSS, which was the software he used. It was very interesting learning how the exit polls were done.

I do not think Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is very relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media. Since TV networks got the act changed in 1959, they found a way around the original rules. I do not know if this act is enforced anymore, but I am sure if it was the TV networks would find loopholes to get around it so it does not have much of an effect on what we see on TV. During the primaries, I saw many stories online about a wide variety of the presidential candidates. During the election, I heard nothing about third-party candidates.  I did not even know Ralph Nader was running under the Natural Law Party until I saw it on the ballot when I voted.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 11'/><attribute name='message_id' value='65825'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 11'/><attribute name='message_date' value='12-11-08 15:54:45'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226523285'/><attribute name='author' value='Carrie Dragicevic'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='

This is an audio clip (just ignore the strange video, it&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant) from a recent Howard Stern show, in which he interviews a member of the Ku Klux Klan after Obama&amp;rsquo;s election. The man repeatedly refers to Obama as a n**ger, and insults Howard Stern for being a &apos;Jew and a n**ger-lover&amp;rdquo;. Surprisingly the man, Daniel, isn&amp;rsquo;t overly nasty.  He expresses his disappointment in the American people for election Obama, but seems to kind of resign himself to it and whatever destruction it causes. His wife, on the other hand, is incredibly offensive, even calling Obama&amp;rsquo;s kids &apos;little monkeys&amp;rdquo; and saying they had better put barbed wire around the fence of the &apos;Black House&amp;rdquo; to keep them in.
 
As ridiculously offensive as I found both of these people (particularly the woman) I respect their right to express their opinions, though I personally wish they&amp;rsquo;d rethink them. Whatever your political beliefs, I can&amp;rsquo;t endorse pain old racism. But she has every right to tell the world what she thinks, and Stern has every right to use her for entertainment purposes.
 
Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the outcome of the election. I voted for Obama because I believe McCain would be four years of the same stuff we&amp;rsquo;ve had for the last 8 years, and we need to make changes if we want to put this country back together. My choice had nothing to do with Obama being black, and &amp;ndash; though I think it&amp;rsquo;s great that we&amp;rsquo;ve made history this year &amp;ndash; I honestly couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less about it. I think he has the potential to be a good leader and pick good people to help him. I&amp;rsquo;m realistic about it though. I think all politicians are corrupt and lie to us. Obama&amp;rsquo;s not a saint. I just hope he&amp;rsquo;s an improvement. 
 
I think Section 315 is a good thing and should definitely be implemented, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it has been. There seemed to be an even amount of air-time for the two main candidates, but you never saw anything about the others. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize there were others until I went to vote. In fact, Stephen Colbert got more coverage when he jokingly announced he would run for president.
 
Here is a link to an article about Ralph Nader. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it when it first came out. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t &apos;headline news&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anything about the other candidates ever was.

The recent ban on gay marriage has caused much controversy as people believe it is breaking constitutional law.  Prior to the election, one person who was extremely vocal on the topic was Ellen Degeneres.  There are many clips on you tube that show her expressing her opinions on many of her shows.  The one in particular that I chose replayed her conversation with John McCain when he attended her show.  She was very vocal and expressed her disdain when McCain stated that he believed that marriage to him was meant for a man and a woman.  Years and years ago and in many countries today I don&apos;t think people could be as vocal about gay marriage as Ellen was or even have a chance to debate the issue with someone in power. 

I have never felt so much excitement about an election ever in my life.  To live through something so historical is beyond description.  Growing up, you learn and hear about JFK and how charismatic he was and how America mourned his death.  When Barack Obama was elected I understood that a little more.  I was elated when he won.  There is something so refreshing about him.  On the other side though, its been crazy to see and hear how opponents of Barack Obama have been reacting.  I have a friend who lives in Arizona who was telling me that some people that he has met truly believe Obama is the anti christ.  Even during the campaign,  there was talk that Obama is Arab or Muslim....that he maintains relationships with terrorists. Its great to see that he still won by a landslide even against all those odds.  It really shows that when people really believe in something, it can happen.  I am also excited about proposal 2.........I was really fighting for that one.  

I can understand how this act can be helpful in allowing citizens to hear other candidates. Its ideal but far from realistic.  For the longest time I had no idea who the other candidates even were.  One of them  I didn&apos;t even hear about until I saw the actual ballot.   I can see how this section of the act made sense at first but with the amendments and exemptions, they just managed to find a way around the act.  Newcasts, debates, press conferences....all places people go to get information on the candidates. The fact that they are exempt for the Act, contradictes the purpose of the Act.

Yeah, I worked with the campaign and I was literally thrown off of some people&apos;s lawns because they would say, &apos;Get off my lawn! I will not support a Muslim!&apos; Or &apos;Obama is a terrorist!&apos; You just had to say, &apos;Thank you.&apos; and walk away. It was really annoying though and it was so hard to not get angry right back. I am glad that he won and that the voters were educated in this election because the numbers really reflected that. There was that one video with John McCain and someone said, &apos;Obama...he&apos;s a muslim...and a terrorist,&apos; and McCain took the microphone away and said, &apos;No..no...that&apos;s not true. He&apos;s a good man and a family man.&apos; It was so ridiculous because republicans were praising McCain for being supportive of Obama or whatever when McCain acted like being a Muslim was a bad thing or something. Anyway, that was irritating. This country still has a long way to go even though Obama was elected. It&apos;s progress, though!

It&apos;s great to see that he still won by a landslide even against all those odds.  It really shows that when people really believe in something, it can happen.

Yay!!! Everyone&apos;s hard work paid off! I was about to move to Toronto if he didn&apos;t win. I&apos;m so glad that I can be proud to live in my country and say that I was a part of making change happen.

This is a video of an opinionated gay boy named Chris Crocker who became famous after the infamous performance Britney Spears gave at the VMAs soon after her breakdown, which received widespread criticism. In this video, the dedicated Britney fan, Chris discusses the very controversial issue of homosexuals being asked to serve in the military and keep their sexual orientation or preferences to themselves with the &apos;Don&amp;rsquo;t Ask, Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell&amp;rdquo; rule. He even goes to the extent of saying that the President just wants to make that rule so he can have gays serve and be killed off, and that gays should not be inclined to defend a country which has denied them their inalienable rights such as being able to get married to their partners and receive a marriage certificate if they choose to do so.
 
 
            I must say I was both very shocked and pleased when Senator Obama became the President elect. I honestly must admit that the reason for my shock was the fact that I doubted the system because the system is run by people ; Humans who are imperfect and have biases, some who are racist, so I obviously had doubts. I just imagined that there would be some kind of &apos;recount&amp;rdquo; and a rerun of the last eight years would be the result. However, I am more than happy I was proven wrong and am floored with the outcome of this election. The best part about this is I have not only lived history, but took a part in making it. My first year I was of age to vote and it was a historical election filled with monumental moments. I could not be more pleased and I am confident President Obama will bring about a much needed change. J
 
I do believe that section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is definitely relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media climate. It is critical that the media which is heavily relied on for information is neutral and delivers both sides to every issue, therefore, allowing every American to think for themselves and make their own decisions and draw their own conclusions.

In this website, it explains the content of the lyrics in greater depth and how they relate to the African American group members and their various struggles as well as day to day life through their eyes.  Music is an example of freedom of speech if you consider the artists&amp;rsquo; lyrics on the album&amp;hellip; but a lot of lyrics are censored for regular FM play.

Freedom, as with everything, comes with caveats.

My freedom of speech regarding the election:
I fully expected that Barack Obama would be the next president; he was by far the &amp;lsquo;popular&amp;rsquo; candidate and received a lot of mainstream press attention.  I used to subscribe to US Weekly and he and his family were on the cover; McCain was not.  He had the support of most of Hollywood and I believe that helped his popularity with the young and first time voters.  I also believe the fact that we&amp;rsquo;ve had a Republican in office for the last eight years led many to vote for change, so to speak.  Regarding McCain and young voters, I feel his age was unfavorable in their eyes.  To someone who&amp;rsquo;s eighteen, 72 is ancient. I&amp;rsquo;m not disagreeing that McCain is old, but as we grow older, we begin to see that people live well beyond 72, his age becomes less of a factor and that experience counts. I also believe the state of the economy influenced much of the vote.  Many Americans see George W. as the reason the economy is in this current condition, not realizing the various circumstances outside of Bush&amp;rsquo;s control that led to this state and ignoring the fact that it is not just America that is in this crisis, but the world as a whole. This is my diplomatic opinion regarding the election.
 
 
Do you think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate? Did you see any broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain and Obama? Post an example link if available.
 
I think Section 315 is a great idea in theory; however, the candidates only need to be afforded equal opportunity.  If one candidate has much more campaign money than another, the candidate with more funding can monopolize the airwaves &amp;ndash; the other candidate only needs to be offered the same opportunity for airtime which may not equal the same amount of airtime.  It all comes down to the funding. 
 
Regarding other presidential candidate&amp;rsquo;s stories, there were plenty of stories.  Below is a link to Sen. Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s primary race. There were no shortages of stories on Hillary.

1. In the video linked above, a University of Florida student is arrested for practicing free speech. It is at a presidential rally for John Kerry when he was running for president in 2004 against George Bush. He poses his question and gets ambushed and tazed by several security guards. Here, the student is not given his freedom of speech. 

In the video, apparently, he asks a question that is off limits. The security guards did not allow him to continue and arrested him using force. There is still a lawsuit in the works, where the student is suing for excessive force and freedom of speech.

My Views of the Election:
As much as I hate to admit it, I voted for the losing half of the ticket for the presidential election. I was not really a fan of either candidate, but was really put of by Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s lack of experience. In fact, it still troubles me to think that our president has absolutely no executive experience.

I am rooting hard for Obama to turn around our country, especially in the area of the economy. But for America to elect a leader that has proven nothing in his experience in either his time in Chicago or in the senate is baffling to me. Again, I am not a staunch republican that is bitter over a McCain loss, just nervous about our country in the days to come.

2. I do not think that this act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate. I only heard some ads for a few Presidential candidates besides McCain and Obama. The candidate was Ron Paul. 
Also, between the two main candidates I still think that there is some media bias. I think that it is pretty widely accepted that Obama received more media attention that John McCain.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: week 11 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='67103'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: week 11 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='16-11-08 18:13:40'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226877220'/><attribute name='author' value='Charles Thomas'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I have been saying that all along.

As everyone knows, this past election was an extremely historic one.  I think that there are too many people that believe that Obama is going to be our savior.  I also think that the two party system that this country uses is a joke.  I did vote this past election, not for Obama or McCain.  It is insane for the greatest country on the planet to really only have two options to vote for.  I believe that McCain was going to take this country in the complete wrong direction if he was elected and I really don&amp;rsquo;t think that Obama is ready to lead our nation.  History has taught us that the economy is going to do what it is going to do no matter who is our president, and that includes the great Barack Obama.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I think that is awesome that for the first time this country has elected an African American president, I think it shows that racism in this country barely exists anymore.  Other than the first African American president, the only other good thing that came out of this election is knowing that Bush will no longer be leading our country.

Obviously I think that section 315 of the 1934 communications act is very relevant.  Everyones voice should be allowed to be heard no matter what you stand for, within certain boundaries of course.  The reason that you dont hear from the little guy anymore is because the elections are all about who can raise the most money, It&apos;s sad and pathetic but it is the truth.

I believe that at his point, no wo/man can come in and just save our country, I think we can both agree that after Bush, we just need to heal. Obama, is the only one that was running that was able to show me that he was nothing like the last guy, I voted him because in him I see someone who can possibly bring our country together again.

This video is a commercial regarding Proposition 8, which was on the California ballot this past election.  It tells us to vote no, which would have allowed homosexuals to continue to get married in California.  The commercial was meant to imitate that of the Apple corporation featuring the Mac and PC guys, only in this one, there is one guy who is for gay marriage (against Proposition 8) and one who is against gay marriage (for Proposition 8).  The commercial advocates the &apos;no&apos; vote on Prop 8, and supports gay marriage.  The guy on the right with &apos;NO&apos; on his shirt says that he supports equality and freedom of expression/speech.  He also says that the Constitution wouldn&apos;t be changed at all, and in fact would be further enjoyed by more members of our society.  What&apos;s not to like or agree with when it comes to that?

I couldn&apos;t resist this other video I found: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75J3TN9Zzck

It&apos;s opposite of the first; for Prop 8, against gay marriage.  It shows a young girl sitting in the living room with her two (homosexual) fathers.  The video leads us to believe that the two men are married, and as a result the daughter is extremely confused as to what marriage really is.  She tells them that her friend Megan said babies come from women, so the dads try to explain that a man and a woman make the baby, but don&apos;t have to be married to do so like Megan told her.  It pulls at people&apos;s heartstrings by bringing up the idea that children are becoming confused about the idea of marriage.

I&apos;m more for gay marriage than I am against it.  Part of me wants to preserve tradition and ban it, and part of me wants to let love grow between all people, no matter their orientation and pass it.  Preserving tradition has become nearly impossible recently.  We live in a new world, things are different and always changing and there&apos;s no stopping that.  Some heterosexual couples seem to think that their lives will change if the opportunity of marriage is open for homosexuals as well.  How will they change?  What will really be different?  The only thing that will really change is that more people will have more rights.  What&apos;s wrong with that?

Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act states that &apos;during elections broadcast stations must provide equal opportunities and response time for qualified political candidates.&apos;  That doesn&apos;t include print media such as newspapers and other articles (including those online), and I wonder how the Act effects voting today, when the internet seems to reign over television.

I agree with your stance on the gay marriage proposal that was on the California ballot this election year.

As far as seeing any broadcasts of other presidential candidates other than John McCain or Barack Obama, I think I saw one commercial about Ron Paul a long time ago and I saw some stories online about him, but only on alternative media sites. In the New York Times, BBC News etc. I did not see any coverage about anyone else other than Hilary Clinton (long time ago), McCain and Obama. 

I could not be more thrilled with the results of the recent election. I worked for Barack Obama&apos;s campaign and put in many many hours registering voters, canvassing, phone banking etc. I think it&apos;s our time (democrats and young people) to take the floor and be able to voice what we want to voice and be able to get our ideas put into action. All of the long nights, long hours and money put into the advertisements really paid off, but I think the main thing that drove our campaign was the internet. Without it, the campaign would not have been as successful as it is today. I think it would be really interesting if the Civil Rights Movement would have had the internet to tie in with their grass roots movement how much more successful it would have been. Or if it would have helped or hindered the movement?

Although Perez Hilton is a gossip blogger, I think this is a good example of free speech because he says some outrageous things about politicians, celebrities and just about anyone he has a problem with. A lot of the material on Perez Hilton&apos;s site would offend people in other countries or cultures AND I&apos;m sure his blog would not be accepted in many countries. I&apos;m sure it has to be banned in certain countries as well. His blog is an example of material that could only be written in a country that allowed free speech. For example, he posts pictures of the Pope and writes over them in a paint program, &apos;The Boss.&apos; This is not exactly respectful and I&apos;m sure many religious people and those in the religious community would be offended if they saw it. In other religions and other cultures, this type of behavior could get you jailed or executed. During the presidential race, he nicknamed Sarah Palin &apos;Sexy Sarah&apos; and even wrote over her daughter Bristol&apos;s picture, &apos;Whore&apos; because of her teen pregnancy. He treated the whole Republican Party pretty awful during the presidential race and writes over Bush&amp;rsquo;s pictures, &apos;Idiot.&amp;rdquo; In other countries, talking about a leader this way could get you put in jail or killed. Finally, he speaks out a lot about gay rights issues. He has talked countries like Iran down to shame for executing 3 17-year-old boys for being homosexual and is currently talking down California&amp;rsquo;s decision on proposal 8.

Above is a video of the famous &apos;I have a Dream&apos; speech by Martin Luther King.
This is a protest speech. Martin Luther King demonstrates the right to speak freely about a problem within american society.  He would have not been able to do that in a country like Iran, which shows that freedom of speech is a true testament of democracy.

As it has been said many times, the recent election is a huge part of history, and I&apos;m proud to say that the first person I ever voted for anything was in this past historic making election.  I voted for Obama so I am obviously pleased with the outcome.  I&apos;m anxious to see how his term goes.  I am a little nervous for him being that there are still many racist people out there.  Some of the things I hear said about him, along with other racist acts really make me feel sad.  America voted for change, and hopefully they will get it. 

I do think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is still relevant in today&apos;s media climate.  I think it&apos;s important for the public to be exposed to all canidates running, and all of their options.  However, I only saw news and information reported on John McCain and Barak Obama.  I didn&apos;t even know there were any other options.  During this election there was definatly mostly only coverage of the republican and democratic parties.

I the video I chose was the speech of Martin Luther King , &apos;I had a  dream speech&apos;, where it shows the true  use of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech as helped this country become much more diverse and more accepting of others who are different. Martin Luther King, Jr. was integral part of  United States becoming a more accepting of African Americans, and all the stereotypes, and racism that goes on. It was apparent in the election as well. We have come so far as to have a president-elect be a African- American, which I think is a great stride in this country becoming more accepting and unified. 

Question #2: 

Section 315 of the Communication Act  &apos;mandates that during elections broadcast stations must provide opportunities and response time for qualified political candidates.&apos; This is still very relevant todays media and with the election of 2008.  I did not see any broadcast besides of the two candidates, because I was not really looking for it.

Question 1: Find an Example of Free Speech Online:

&apos;In 2006, an international survey conducted by the human rights organization Freedom House reported that about 83 percent of the world&apos;s people live in countries with a less-than-free press and that seventy-one nations had virtually no press freedom. Although Kenya and Mauritania recently improved their press standing from &apos;Not Free&apos; to &apos;Partly Free&apos;, other nations (such as Russia) have declined in press freedom in recent years.&apos;

Find an example of Free Speech online (video or text) and discuss it in 100 words or more. (on any topic)
 
I actually found an article from Business Week magazine that fits into the topic of free speech in the workplace. Bruce Barry, a professor at Vanderbilt University, conducted a study in regards to the status of free speech in one&amp;rsquo;s place of employment. His study showed that employers have much more power over our personal lives than ever before. I think this study would be very interesting. It is so common today for people to have personal blogs or websites, such as Facebook or Myspace, which allows them to exercise their right of freedom of speech but should they be penalized at work for it if the employer doesn&amp;rsquo;t agree? I do not think that is fair at all. Nor do I think one should not be hired based on a blog or a person&amp;rsquo;s personal opinion. One harsh example of freedom of speech that was pointed out in this article was an Alabama woman who lost her job simply for having a John Kerry bumper sticker on her car. That seems so extreme and harsh to me! This is definitely a complicated issue and one that may be a concern to a lot of people. If you have time, read this article, it is definitely an interesting take on this topic.

Exercise your freedom of speech! Include your own thoughts on the results of the recent election., in 100 words or more. 
 
The 2008 Presidential election is definitely one to remember and go down in the history books! Honestly, the reason that I think Barack Obama won was in fact due to the huge turnout of first-time voters as well as the younger generation voters who were looking for &apos;change&amp;rdquo;. I know that many of us have commented on this before but I really feel that by Obama appearing on late night television shows and appealed to a mass amount of these voters and therefore he won their votes. Frankly, I feel that John McCain may have followed in Obama&amp;rsquo;s footsteps when appearing on these shows simply because he felt like he had too. Another item that may have contributed to Obama&amp;rsquo;s win is the fact that many Americans are sick of the way the Republican Party has made things and are ready for a &apos;change&amp;rdquo; and are willing to give the Democratic Party a try. Regardless of the outcome I feel like either of these two candidates was more than qualified and able to be our next President.

Question 2: Read the section on Political Broadcasts and Equal Opportunity and answer the following:

Do you think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate? Did you see any broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain and Obama? Post an example link if available.
 
I do think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media climate in regards to the two primary candidates. For example, Barack Obama bought some time on Fox and actually set back the start time of a World Series game. I specifically remember Fox making a public statement that they were happy to help Senator Obama and if requested would do the same for Senator McCain therefore allowing the same opportunity to both candidates. 
 
In regards to broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain or Obama, I do not recall seeing any. I think even think that I saw any commercials during the primaries but I do recall newsprint as well as online stories about all candidates.

After the incidents of september 11th and the terrorist attacks, many thought that their freedom of speech was violated because people were being culturally attacked based on their ethnicity, race, skin color even religious preferences! This was implemented because of the governments rights of invading personal privacy. Many felt that they did not have the opportunities to express their individual rights and their freedom of speech and expression were taken away from them. This picture depicts a young muslim guy mocking the supposed ideas and rights of the freedom of expression by implying that it does not exist and has been taken away. Personally, being a young muslim girl myself I personally feel that certain freedoms of mine have been violated. Especially with the governments ability to tap into phone lines and conversations of suspected &apos;terrorists&apos; which they generally categorized by names and appearance as well as through associations. Take for example in the airport when one is going through and the name &apos;mohammad&apos; is called everyone turns and looks and they take extra precautions towards that person with that name! As it happens quite a bit to my uncles, and we are indian! that does not make us intended terrorists. It is all quite stereotypical, and although we are allowed certain &apos;freedoms&apos; still they are quite restricted! and need to be earned. It seems it is based on the feelings of trust which is the root of the issue. The same works for a household, kids need to earn the trust of their parents in order to obtain certain freedoms.

This was a very interesting artice that in my opinion very bluntly lays out much of the problems with america today.  The columnst, Bob Herbert, talks about all of the issues that plague america today and also some others that seem to get far less attention.  The article calls out Americans for being uneducated and lazy. Many times we fail to realize that hard work and dedication seem to be a thing of the past.  Basically, the article is listing all the reasons why Americans need to vote.  The country is facing many problems and everyone needs to voice their opinion and get the people into office they want.

My thouhgts on the election are those of the excitied variety.  Excited to see the country making a move into a new direction under new leadership. Excitied to see more people participating in the election. Excited to see more young people getting involved in politics. The country spoke out and said that they wanted to make a change in order to solve the problems that are facing America, and change is coming.  However, if we are to continue to evolve politically, I think a push needs to be made for more political parties.  Look at England and all the various major parties that they have. Although this may be a long way off, it will be neccesary in the future in order to have a better democracy.

I do not think that section 315 of the communications act is relevent becuase we only ever see two major candidates from two different parties.  There are other lesser known parties in America, such as the Green Party, but you rarely see TV ads supporting them.  Back in the day you would see some ads for Newt Gingritch, but that was becuase he was a billionare. This past election I only saw ads run by the Obama or McCain and that was it.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 11'/><attribute name='message_id' value='66724'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 11'/><attribute name='message_date' value='14-11-08 22:37:35'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226720255'/><attribute name='author' value='Heba Abouarabi'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Free speech is a very important right that we enjoy here in our country that many other countries lack or don&amp;rsquo;t provide their citizens. It&amp;rsquo;s something that we often take for granted and sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t take advantage of. I think we have examples of free speech all around us. A daily TV show called the View which is broadcasted daily on a major television network, brings together five women who have five different points of view that they discuss on television in front of millions of people everyday. This is a prime example of people exercising their right of free speech. During the past presidential election the conversations got very heated among the women because they felt very strongly about their opinions however they were encouraged to express themselves. I think when people see that they too are also encouraged to participate in dialogue and to express their opinion. Below is a link to an episode where the women where exercising their right to free speech. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXQeEo7KpeA
 
I think the presidential election that took place this year was a good experience for America as a whole regardless of who you voted for. This election was witness too the highest voter turn out in a very long time proving that when people really believe that their vote matters and their voices will be heard, they will actually participate. Many of the young people who voted in this election were voting for the first time, and were very existed to be part of such an important election in American history.
 
Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is also known as the equal time rule states that any broadcasting station that is giving air time to a presidential candidate or politician during an election must provide &apos;equal time&amp;rdquo; to all other candidates running for that office. I think that this section of the act is especially important in out time today in order to provide people with balanced information when they are looking to make their decision on who they will vote for. I think that this election was somewhat balanced however much improvement is still needed before our media outlets become truly balanced and fair in their reporting.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 11 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='67244'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 11 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='16-11-08 22:49:33'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226893773'/><attribute name='author' value='Janice David'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I liked your choice of article for free speech.

He personally addresses George W. Bush in the middle of his rant, &amp;lsquo;I accuse you Mr. Bush of lying this country into war. I accuse you of creating false link between Saddam Hussein and 9-11&amp;hellip;.&amp;rsquo; Going on to say that Bush is responsible for everything that our Country is fighting against, and is creating it instead of fighting it.

Personally, I agree with Keith Olberman, I hate George W. Bush. I cannot wait until we are done with him and we can have some change in the White House. Although, I have to be honest, I am very, very worried about the decision making of the President Elect, when at his first news conference I see Jennifer Granholm standing behind him. Although, I am happy to know that the President Elect is paying attention to the economy in Michigan, I am nervous that she is on his advisory board. I think Granholm would make a great Supreme Court Justice, but, on a financial stand point, NO THANK YOU!!!
2)      I think that section 315 is somewhat relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media because, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the big two, Fox and CNN as examples, the big networks usually try to have a counter argument on their show to appear as though they are being fair. However, I believe that these big networks cheat their way out of this because generally when they have opposing view points on as guests, they have people who are not nearly as well rehearsed as the interviewer. For example Keith Olberman, or Bill O&amp;rsquo;Rilley only have people on whom they know they can eat alive and make look like the opposing person is wrong. I say, let&amp;rsquo;s get all the loud mouths from each station to have it out, like Presidential debate where they cannot just  yell over each other. Which is what Bill O&amp;rsquo;Riley loves to do with his less than adequate guests, he just yells over them and tells them to &amp;lsquo;SHUT UP.&amp;rsquo;'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Keith Olberman '/><attribute name='message_id' value='66833'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Keith Olberman '/><attribute name='message_date' value='15-11-08 17:13:51'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226787231'/><attribute name='author' value='Sarah Wegener'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Hi Kristine!

This is a video of an ederly woman who was attacked for expressing her view that marriage should be defined as the union between one man and one woman.  This woman was carrying a cross in protest of gay marriages.  She was brutally attacked, her cross thrown to the ground and she was also knocked to the ground and assaulted.  The new anchorman ended the segment by stating that there was hostility &apos;frankly&amp;rdquo; on both sides.  This was not evident in the video, the only people who were hostile and assaulting were the pro-gay marriage protestors.  Not all of the protestors were hostile, most wanted to keep peace while expressing their views.  The woman who was attacked did not retaliate, even though she was hit and spit on simply because she had a different view.

2008 Presidential Election
 
While I think that President Elect Obama is charismatic, intelligent and capable of leading the United States to some great successes, his views on moral issues grieve me. President Bush has clearly made some mistakes; it was insane to believe that he would have been perfect; after all he is just a man. But I think that Sen. Obama was elected simply by saying the opposite of what we had experienced over the last eight years. I understand that it is historical and exciting for the great step that our nation had made by breaking the racial barrier and electing an African American. I am not discounting the accomplishments of Sen. Obama but I have to believe that no matter what color you were if you expressed an opposition to President Bush you would have won the election this year. 
 
I am a proud African American woman, one of few who supported McCain. I believe that you will never find a candidate that you totally agree with so I take the issue that is closest to my heart and I vote that way. The issue that is closest to me is abortion. I have never and will never vote for someone who is not pro-life. Of course there are things about Mr. Obama that I adore and admire but his views on abortion are scary to me. I believe that in this day, there is no such thing as an unplanned pregnancy. There are simply too many forms of birth control, including good old-fashioned abstinence. I am not insensitive to people who are affected in cases of rape or incest. Ten years ago, I faced this tough decision when I was raped by someone that I had considered a friend for many years.

     In this article, a pastor is sentenced to prison for telling a judge what God might do to him unless he changed his ruling. I think this creates an argument on the fine line of what is &apos;Free Speech&apos; and what is a &apos;Threat&apos;. I personally feel that from case to case it does vary, however in my opinion if an individual gives you some form of an ultimatum in order to change that person&apos;s mind, it is considered a threat. In this case the Pastor gives a &apos;warning&apos; to the Judge of what God might do to him. I personally think that the pastor did provide a threat of somesort in order to change a person&apos;s (Judge) mind.

Exercise your freedom of speech! Include your own thoughts on the results of the recent election., in 100 words or more. 

     I think that the recent election provided more youthful voters out in the polls as well as increasing the number of voters that participated. Although I am not content with the outcome of the election I am quite impressed with the activity and participation of more and more people in the election and actually having their voice heard. This election has probably given more people confidence in their voice being heard and actually having meaning. In my opinion, this election will change our future elections in a good way. By getting more people out and into the polls, more of America is having a say in &apos;who&apos; our next President will be. The only downfall to our electoral process is the lack of education within the process for normal citizens. I feel that in order to vote, one must have a single class in American Politics to better understand how they work. I feel that the US should issue Grants to people or come up with a way that an individual can get to their nearest community college and have access to the class.

Question 2: Read the section on Political Broadcasts and Equal Opportunity and answer the following:
Do you think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate? 

     I believe that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate. I feel that the two larger parties get more coverage than any of the smaller parties, however I feel that all parties are given equal oppurtunities. I just feel that the larger and better funded parties can make more of the oppurtunities because of the money they control. I do think it is slightly unfair that the media is based off of the money power one party has, however that is how the world works.

Free Speech online example:

WHICH hunk in a summer movie is a violent, closeted homosexual? The heartthrob snuck into his ex&apos;s apartment a few months ago and raped him so violently, the ex ended up in the hospital - and the actor paid him $500,000 to keep his mouth shut . . . WHICH oft-photographed socialite is being forced to get a job by her parents? She looks rich but is really broke, and is now looking for modeling gigs . . . WHICH Mideast prince with a large posse is a bad tipper? The oil-soaked royal is leaving gratuities of just 10 percent in hot spots in St. Tropez. (NY Post Online)
http://www.nypost.com/seven/08182008/gossip/pagesix/just_asking_124895.htm

This &apos;blind item&apos; was posted on NY Post Online and is a prime example of free speech at free speech at its worst. Now, I really don&apos;t have a clue as to who these &apos;blind items&apos; are about but a lot of others probably do and that&apos;s disturbing because much of this filth is still anyone&apos;s business. Furthermore, this piece is kind of disgusting because it discusses a violent rape which is a crime which means someone is a victim. And, last time I checked victims have rights to privacy.  Certain things should not be discussed in a public forum so frivolously, especially an act of violence as brutal as rape regardless of whether the victim is male or female.

My thoughts on the recent election are pure comedy in regards to the Republican Party. This due in part to the antics of Saturday Night Live and more specifically Tina Fey. My love for the Clinton&apos;s quickly turned to a strong dislike due to Hilary&apos;s &apos;I deserve to be President. It&apos;s the only reason I stuck by Bill through that whole Lewinsky ordeal&apos; attitude. McCain should start his own party: the Geriatric Party. And that &apos;dingbat&apos; Palin should start on her own beauty/charm school. I am thrilled that Barack Hussein Obama is the new president-elect of the United States of America. Finally, this country&apos;s name has manifested. 

I think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is not relevant in today&apos;s media climate because Rupert Murdoch is going to do whatever the hell he pleases because he&apos;s loaded. I said that to say that if someone has the dime they can buy the time and that&apos;s all that pretty much matters currently. Television networks, newspapers, websites and radio stations are businesses and advertising is their primary source of income. It just so happens that Mr. Murdoch owns his own cable news network therefore he doesn&apos;t have to purchase anyone else&amp;rsquo;s time. He can spew his hatred for the Democratic Party on his own dime/time. I did not see that many other broadcasts or online posts about presidential candidates other than Senators Barack and Mccain. Or, I probably wasn&apos;t paying attention. I seem to suffer from the same terminal illnesses as Rupert Murdoch: tunnel vision and narrow mindedness.

First off I would like to say that I am glad that the election is finally over. This was my first time voting, since I&amp;rsquo;m only twenty years old.  I would have to say that I am satisfied with the results of the election. I myself did vote for Barak Obama. I was also very excited to see that many young individuals got out and expressed their rights to vote.   Overall, I think it would be great to see if there will be a change in the government.

I personally do not think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate.  I hardly heard ads for a few Presidential candidates besides McCain and Obama. The candidate was Ron Paul.  I also think that between the two main candidates that there was a large amount of biased media.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 11 Assignment'/><attribute name='message_id' value='66661'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 11 Assignment'/><attribute name='message_date' value='14-11-08 17:27:07'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226701627'/><attribute name='author' value='Jacob Akers'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EggJyKHPyl0&amp;feature=related

This video has to deal with people who use free speech in ways that are socially unacceptable. Part of this video is meant to be funny, but the issues it raises about Nazi&apos;s having free speech is a real issue. 

When people think of free speech they usually think of people being allowed to voice their own harmless opinions, rarely do people realize that even those who are spreading hate filled messages have the same rights, even though their views aren&apos;t always harmless. This is something that I have a hard time dealing with, but free speech cannot be denied to everyone because a few abuse it. 

I have mixed views on the election.  I personally am socially conservative, but I couldn&apos;t justify voting for McCain who has never made that a priority. I wonder how someone can vote for a candidate that admittedly doesn&apos;t know much about the economy, when that is currently the number one issue. 

I liked Palin, and I think McCain chose her to make a splash. He figured that he wouldn&apos;t win unless he took a risk. I wish Palin would have refused and waited for a better time in the future. She may be too tarnished now to ever be a legitamite candidate again. 

Equal Opportunity- In our two party system, it is very hard for someone to get &apos;true&apos; equal opportunity. The money, current power, and media companies are already tied to the two parties. Not to mention, that most people do not take third party candidates seriously, so the media is hard pressed to cover them for fear of losing ratings. 

Candidate Bob Barr visited U of M dearborn earlier this year, and almost no one knew it. It was so poorly covered that the event was empty.

Above is media put together by the BBC news, showing a news brief during the attacks of Tiananmen Square. I have to admit that I have heard &apos;Tiananmen Square Masaqure&apos; just recently, but never knew what it meant. When I was googling and searching for free speech examples, I came across some speeches done by Chai Ling, to the students in the square. I searched more and more, and learned about this incident a bit. While although what I have learned is not much, and I am sure that there is so much more to know, what I have concluded is that the students in the square were angry about something and were excersizing their voices in disagreement. They were on protest. They were un-armed, but the words they spoke and simply just being there annoyed the government of China. Many elders took action, by speaking to the students, to attempt to disengage the group. When that failed, the government started to kill them. It is a sad site. Here in the US we have protests and marches to bring attention to something that we are passionate about. In the past, I am sure there was violence involved. I can not imagine that it could or would ever escalate to the degree that it did in the square that day. I believe that we all, as humans, philosophacilly have the freedom (ability) to speak what we like. Our actions have concequences though, even here in the US. When many talk about the freedom of speech, what they are really saying is they want freedom from concequece. But, do we, even here in the US have freedom of concequence? Before answering yes, think about the boss that finds his employee attractive, the retail clerk that doesn&apos;t like that you want paper instead of plastic, and the child that doesn&apos;t agree with what mom or dad is saying. We ask for these freedoms, perhaps we are really looking for different concequences from our choices to open and and exhale.

My opinon of the current election: I am anxious to see what will happen next. It is exciting to have a new president elected. The economy is in rough shape. The world views us poorly, It would be wonderful if the new Commander in Chief can help bring this nation back on the right track. I am concerned for the safety of O&apos;Bama and his family. Unfortunatly, it takes only one determined person to bring him down. While although it would be nice to think that predjudice and racism no longer exist, it does. 

2.)
I think that all parties should be involved in campaigning. If there is going to be a debate, invite them all. Somehow we need to have more choices then just two. Not everyone in the US has the access to different forms of media in order to make a sound decision. I did not hear of any canadites or see them anywhere over the past few months. I may not have watched enough TV or read enough papers though, but in the little bit of time that I did, O&apos;Bama and McCain were surely the topics of discussion. Who was Ron Paul&apos;s VP choice? Did he even have one? Below, I searched online to see if any footage even exsisted: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2PUZoukfA

Above is an excerpt from CNN news, regarding Ron Paul. There is information out there on Ron Paul. He was on TV speaking about his positions. You have to be looking for it though. The amount of time he was given on TV compared to O&apos;Bama and McCain is hugely different. The third parties get little coverage and focus, to the point where they don&apos;t really exist, unless you either stumble upon them or search them out.

This may not be quite the example the professor was looking for, but I thought it represented a wonderful representation of a university recognizing the student&amp;rsquo;s need for free speech. What I chose to feature is the &apos;Free Expression Tunnel&amp;rdquo; located on North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s State University&amp;rsquo;s campus. The tunnel was built in 1939 and has been the platform for free speech during many historic and controversial times in American culture such as the Vietnam War. The wide array of messages and artwork continually change as the tunnel is repainted everyday to allow room for more voices to be expressed.

The first two links I have included provide background information and photos of the tunnel, and are definitely worth a look, but the last link features an article that first brought the tunnel to my attention. The article explains how a unity rally was organized by students and administrators in response to a death threat against the new president-elect, Barak Obama, along with a KKK symbol that was written on one of the walls in the Free Expression Tunnel. Many were upset by the lack of response from the chancellor and lack of information period. One of the purposes of the rally was to condemn these types of hate-filled messages and raise awareness that threats and intimidation are not examples of free speech. It was also a challenge to the university to be more proactive in taking the necessary steps to educate about and put an end to messages of hate. 

Include your own thoughts on the results of the recent election:

I thought the election was more a made for TV movie than an actual serious election for the President of the United States. There was a &apos;hot&amp;rdquo; girl in skimpy clothes singing love songs to one of the candidates, a plumber, who was not a plumber, was the star of the last debate and the first woman vice president candidate rapped on SNL&amp;hellip;definitely not your typical presidential election. McCain&amp;rsquo;s decision to select Palin as his running mate seemed like a last minute ditch effort to collect some of the women voters after Hillary Clinton was out of the running. No one knew who Palin was and skeleton after skeleton just kept popping out of her closet. Most people just wondered what McCain was thinking. Then you had Barak Obama, another relatively unknown, who just kept repeating the word &apos;change&amp;rdquo; until the nation said &apos;ok.&amp;rdquo; I always look at the election as choosing between the lesser of the two evils, which for me usually means whoever is running on the Democratic ticket, so I guess I got what I wanted???

Question 2: Do you think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate? Did you see any broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain and Obama? 

I think it is extremely relevant today. The public needs to see other views besides the majority (republican and Democratic) when making their decision on who should be president. Unfortunately, I do not think that the mandate is being enforced. I heard so many people complaining about the limited options of candidates and some deciding not to vote because they did not like the Republican or Democratic candidate. It&amp;rsquo;s sad that everyone just assumes that either a Republican or Democratic will win and it would be a waste to endorse or vote for anyone else. My first two presidential votes went to Ross Perot and I did not feel like they were wasted. 

The only other candidate I remember seeing anything about was Ron Paul, but until I just looked it up I did not even know what party he was affiliated with.

The first thing I thought about when I read this was to write about the freedom that African Americans had to win in order to vote. African Americans had to fight a hard fight about the right to free speech. The  Freedom of speech in the United States is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and by many state constitutions and state and federal laws. However, while freedom of expression by non-speech means is commonly thought to be protected under the First Amendment, the Supreme Court has only recently taken this view. As late as 1968, the Supreme Court stated that regulating non-speech can justify limitations on speech. The U.S.  has gone so far over the years to promote freedom. Not only does the first amendment protect the right of freedom for expression but it gave Americans the right to religion, expression, and press. What&amp;rsquo;s  interesting about this freedom is, is it so free? If we have this freedom, then why are we regulated when t comes to press? In the United States, we can&amp;rsquo;t print, and say what we want to say. We ca be accused of slander, or libel, defamation. We can&amp;rsquo;t talk about the government, and war the way we want. We are controlled. We can&amp;rsquo;t put any type of media on the radio, and television, there are rules and regulations to the media, and the way they are broadcasted. Not to get off the subject, but thinking about the U.S. media, I watched a movie about the Iraq war, the prime Arab news, AL Jazeera said how the American government is false, and fake, and they promote propaganda, to trick Americans into thinking the way they want them to. What we think is so free, is actually not that free. What we think is non-dominated, and mobilized, is very controlled.

When I think about the recent election I found an article about Obama, and his visit to Dr. King church, and I thought about how Obama campaigned for change and Dr. King campaigned for change as well.  I am so happy about the election. I am so excited to know now we have changed and we have brought culture together for unity and change. I think the country is becoming more united. We are absolutely, not all united; however, we have come a long way. The country went from hating African Americas, voting for Senator Obama, and to putting him in office. This is amazing to see the change, we have undergone. The difference with this country is states like Obama, which is predominately white, and racist, Obama actually won that state. That is an example how we have changed. 

Question 2: Read the section on Political Broadcasts and Equal Opportunity and answer the following:
Do you think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate? Did you see any broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain and Obama? Post an example link if available.
I think the Political Broadcast and Equal Opportunity for the recent election was an important subject because the media needed to be equally supportive of both candidates, no matter who they actually supported personally. But be diverse for both parties, because that&amp;rsquo;s equality. The presidential election campaigns reflected Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934; it set equal access to the mass media for both of the political candidates. It allowed access to better organized political parties and both the candidates to influence the media, and that it created a chance for debates, and the candidates got equal air time. Another great factor is Section 315 would bring about a series of debates between presidential candidates during each presidential election year, by television and radio by the national networks. Most of the links online about the last election was about McCain and Senator Obama, there was little links to the other candidates. As a matter of fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know who they are. They made a point to elect these candidates, as most important, and advertise their views, more so than the Green party candidates, and the Libertarians.

Hi Lauren! I definitely think that the US is on the road to being united. We have come a very long way since this country was born in regards to African Americans and this Presidential election proves that. I think this progress is great! After all, every man was created equal!

This article sheds light on some of the problems other countries around the world have in implementing a fair freedom of speech policy. In the article a Thai academic teacher was arrested on charges of insulting Thailand&amp;rsquo;s king in a lecture over a year ago. Sulak Sivaraska 75 criticized the government for its lavish spending on the 2006 celebrations for King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s Golden Jubilee. If charged he can face up to 15 years in prison. This illustrates that some countries still have a long way to go in having just policies for freedom of speech. A classroom should be open to discuss almost anything. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, no one can take that away from them. What Thailand&amp;rsquo;s government is doing is clapping down on people that speak out against it. This is not just or fair. This will only create a state of fear and outrage within its own citizen. Not a healthy mixture for any society.
 
These recent elections have been historical in many ways. I am glad to have been a part of history! I am proud of America. We as a nation have come a long way. Just to think that only 400 years ago a black man was a slave. He had no right to land, to vote, and to own property. To think that a colored person could not drink from the same fountain as a white person is mindboggling. Now our nation as voted and accepted a colored person to lead them and become their president is amazing. America is the land of opportunity and this election reaffirms that. Anyone can become anything if he/she works hard to get their. America needs change. We as a people need to continue to work hand in hand to make a difference. Let&amp;rsquo;s continue to change history for the better. Let us leave this nation in a better condition for children and grandchildren.
 
Question 2:
Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act authorizes that &apos;during elections, broadcasters must provide equal opportunities and response time for qualified political candidates.&amp;rdquo; This act is should be in relevant today&amp;rsquo;s media climate. But the reality is that it is not. Almost all broadcasters had coverage  exclusively on Obama and McCain. I did not see any coverage on Ralph Nader on any other third part. Every candidate should have equal coverage no matter how well funded is party is. I understand that most media outlets are not interested in covering poorly funded third party candidates, they rather cover the big shot candidates and what the public is more likely appeal to. But it is only fair to give each candidate the necessary coverage no matter how established their parties are.

1.       The article that I have found is a really controversial topic. The article was about a group of atheist getting together, spending $40,000 on campaigns on buses in Washington DC with a picture of Santa Clause and the phrase &apos;Why believe in God? Just be good for goodness sake.&amp;rdquo; Recently more and more people have a problem with what should be allowed as decorations for Christmas. I suppose everyone has their right to freedom of speech on what they think is appropriate or right for decorations but I don&amp;rsquo;t see how we will ever all agree and get along on this topic. 
 
2.       I feel as though it will be a rough road for Obama in the beginning. Not only because there are many racist people out there still but because our economy is so horrible right now that it is going to take a lot to get us on the right track. I am very proud however that America has taken steps to overcome the racist problem we have. I am excited to see if he will hold true to changing America as much as he spoke of. I actually think that he did somewhat change America a little bit by just being elected since it is such a huge step for us. 
 
3.       I do think Section 315 of 1934 Communications Act is still relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media coverage. I think it is only fair to give each candidate an equal opportunity. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be up to the media to decide if they want to air a specific candidate&amp;rsquo;s speech or ads so we only see what the media wants us to see. I did not see any coverage over a third party candidate. I heard when the election first start going about Ralph Nader and the Green Party as always. I did try and find an example of this years third party and nothing showed up. I even googled who were the presidential candidates for 2008 and it only showed up with McCain and Obama.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 11 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='67212'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 11 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='16-11-08 22:13:53'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226891633'/><attribute name='author' value='Holly Williams'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='you bring up a very interesting point.

Also, these very same people had no problem with spending the money that reads In God We Trust so why should they care about what decorations are.

Obama and Hillary changed America when they announced ran for the Presidential election.
Obama has already made a very big change too because he ran the most cleaniest campaigns ever ran.  Obama also changed America by not allowing Lobbiest to run his campaign and by not allowing them to put any money in it.  He put the power in the people&apos;s hands.  He believed in us, he empowered us.  He has already changed America and how future elections will be ran.

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/13/national/main1123854.shtml
 
This free speech article talks about a boy who won a debate over a t-shirt he wore in school one day. In 2005, this Dearborn High School student wore a shirt that said &apos;International Terrorist&amp;rdquo; and had a picture of President George Bush on it. To him, he was just expressing his view about how he felt about the war and Bush and so the shirt was his way of accomplishing this.
Although there was a huge controversy whether or not the school could do anything to him for wearing this shirt, the principle of the school said that it did not violate dress code and despite the fact that he didn&amp;rsquo;t approve, there was no real violation. So, the boy was able to express his view about the war in a very public and free way.
(I actually went to elementary school with this student so it was very interesting to see him make headlines)
 
The recent election was nothing short of historic. I stayed up until midnight to watch Obama&amp;rsquo;s acceptance speech and thought it was very powerful. Since I did vote for him, I was very excited about my candidate winning. I think the reason he got elected into office was because people are just getting sick and tired of where the economy had been heading to for the past 8 years.  Obama has given hope for people that change will happen and although it&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen overnight, he will do everything in his power to progress forward in a positive direction.  It is an election that I will always remember and since it made such a monumental mark in history, I am very happy that I was part of it.
 
Question 2:
 
Even though Section 315 of the 1934 Communication is relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s media climate, I feel that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t truly reflect what exactly is actually broadcast. Every channel that I turned to during the presidential election (especially when it came down to only a few days until election days), all I kept seeing was Obama and McCain. Sure there were ads revolving who to choose for judges and Supreme Court, but the two gentlemen that were broadcast much more were the two presidential candidates. If broadcast was to follow this section of fairness, ALL people who were going to be on the ballot on election day should have had equal media time. In reality, the two most crucial people you are going to vote for are the president candidates so I can definitely see why they were seen FAR much more than any other people.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: wk. 11 assignment 1 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='66459'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: wk. 11 assignment 1 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='14-11-08 09:47:54'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226674074'/><attribute name='author' value='Echo Kiser'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree I rarely saw any other air time for anyone but those two.

He refused and the principle got involved. I don&apos;t remember exactly what happened, but I just remember thinking the whole thing was utterly rediculous.

In lieu of the recent election I decided to use the clip from a new Comedy Central series as proof or an example of Freedom of Speech.   While I feel this show, and a lot of its opinions, are very controversial, and perhaps even racist on some level, the Freedom of Speech allows the writers of this show and the producers of Comedy Central to still publicize it.  I find the timing of the show very interested, it only first aired about a week before the results of the election.  It makes me wonder what material the show would be talking about had the results of the election been different. All the same, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see what Free Speech allows.  
As far as my own opinion goes, I found the results of the recent election very interesting.  While I would be one of the first to admit I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel Obama was a strong enough candidate or had enough experience, his actions post election have shown him to be taking the right steps.  He realizes his popularity and does not want that to mislead people into thinking he is the president yet.  Also, he seems to use his publicity in a good way. While the market and the economy have still yet to change, it shows that even though people voted for him they are waiting for other signs that things are actually going to change.  
Question 2
While Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is still important, in today&amp;rsquo;s media it&amp;rsquo;s not relevant.  Today&amp;rsquo;s media makes it costly to afford time on the air, and so the candidates with the most resources grab the most time on the air. While things like the internet help to get the word out there about other candidates, I think it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to tell that there are always two parties and their main candidates that hog most of the air time.  I rarely saw articles about other candidates. 
Here is one article though: http://media.www.themichiganjournal.com/media/storage/paper255/news/2008/11/04/News/Pres-Candidate.Ralph.Nader.Visits.Campus-3527337.shtml
Notice how though it&amp;rsquo;s from a school paper. I rarely saw articles in major news papers or on any of the major news networks about other candidates.  It does not seem fair to me that other candidates to not get as much time in the spotlight.  It would be difficult though for the Communications Act to be enforced today.   News networks want to do well, and they know what the majority of the public wants to see, and usually they don&amp;rsquo;t want to see info on the smaller candidates with less of a chance of winning, the public wants information on the candidates that matter.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='WEEK 11 Assignment Freedom of Expression/Legal Controls'/><attribute name='message_id' value='65957'/><attribute name='message_title' value='WEEK 11 Assignment Freedom of Expression/Legal Controls'/><attribute name='message_date' value='12-11-08 22:18:29'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226546309'/><attribute name='author' value='Michelle Slater'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Find an example of Free Speech online (video or text) and discuss it in 100 words or more.

Below is the link to a Video of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speaking against the Vietnam War, Titled: &apos;Why I am against the Vietnam War.&amp;rdquo;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80Bsw0UG-U

Dr. King is a man beyond ordinary. He was ahead of his time. Whenever I hear one of his speeches, I get overwhelmed with tears; a funny feeling comes over me. I thank God for giving us Dr. Martin Luther King. I can hear the spirit of God when I listen to one of Dr. Martin Luther King speeches. It&amp;rsquo;s funny; I hear God&amp;rsquo;s spirit whenever I hear President Elect Barack Obama speak too. While listening to this speech I can hear many of the same issues we are struggling with today. For example:  Racism, A War, people speaking out against the war, the Government spending millions on the war and little to nothing on Americans or on the soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War.   One thing that caused me to yell while listening to this video is when Dr. King said &apos;I have seen Negro boys and White boys on TV screens as they killed and died together for a nation that&amp;rsquo;s been unable to seat them together in the same school room.&amp;rdquo; What a statement to make, it was very true during those times. However, you can still find this kind of attitude in some areas in the United States today.
 
Exercise your freedom of speech! Include your own thoughts on the results of the recent election, in 100 words or more. 

My thoughts on the results of the election were WOW! I&amp;rsquo;m still in shock. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how much the United States has matured. Even though there were people saying they would not vote for President Elect Barack Obama because he is a black man. I was thinking there were a lot of people who was feeling the same way, and those people are going to show up at the polls in record number. However, I still felt Barack was going to beat John McCain. President Elect Barack Obama wins had the Detroit News go into a 2nd and maybe even a 3rd print of the Newspaper the following morning. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy for American right now, we are going to be looked at in a totally different and yet better way by other countries. We will no longer look bias; we really do look like the land of the free and like a democratic country. I also feel had President Elect Barack been a White man, he would have won back in February or March. Hillary wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had 18 million cracks in the ceiling because those 18 million would have been for him. I pray Barack get to serve 2 terms in the White House. I also wish they would change the name of the White House to America&amp;rsquo;s House. 
 
Question 2: Read the section on Political Broadcasts and Equal Opportunity and answer the following:
Do you think that Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is relevant in today&apos;s media climate?  

It&amp;rsquo;s very relevant. I recall a time during the election when I felt there was more talk and coverage about President Elect Barack Obama and not enough on John McCain.   For Example: I remember seeing Obama on various talk shows and I use to wonder where McCain is or where is Palin. At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know they had cancelled or they didn&amp;rsquo;t want them on at the show at that time. Other things had come up. In order to be completely fair to all parties not just the Democrats and the Republicans, Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is very necessary and is very much needed. It will also help to eliminate any kind of lawsuits, and it help to make the station look as though they are being fair and not showing any favoritism.
 
Did you see any broadcasts or stories online about presidential candidates other than McCain and Obama? 

Yes, I did. Although I did not hear a whole lot about it, I still heard about it and I believe it maybe one of the main reasons he wasn&apos;t picked to be Obama&amp;rsquo;s running mate. Senator John Edwards, Senator Edwards had too much dirty laundry hanging out, not to mention the fact he cheated while his wife was facing personal health challenges.

The Communications Act of 1934 Section 315, the Equal Time Rule, requires broadcasters to afford equal opportunity to candidates seeking political office, and formally included provisions for rebuttal of controversial viewpoints under the contested Fairness Doctrine. The 2008 Elections is a perfect example of this doctrine. Each candidate broadcasted their reasons why the Americans should vote for them and why their opponent was not qualified for the vote. Every news station, online news post, and blogs all had something to say, display, or interprets. 

Attached is a video of the Barack Obama Informercial (30 min) that was broadcasted although many believe that this would hurt his campaign. They were wrong since he was elected and is now the 44th President of the United States.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Reply to Week 11'/><attribute name='message_id' value='66268'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Reply to Week 11'/><attribute name='message_date' value='13-11-08 17:36:27'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226615787'/><attribute name='author' value='Amanda Buelow'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Question 1 Article- http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/MorsevFrederick.html

This is a great example of a free speech violation by a school towards a student. This case is also fairly recent press. Unfortunatly this students expression was muffled by a claus stating that there is free speech to an extent in public schools. Public schools have a right to control what is being broadcast to the masses during school or at school events or functions. This case draws a very thin line towards right and wrong and in my opinion can become a very sticky situation when the right problem arises.

My thoughts on the recent election are that the decison made is the right one for the U.S. To me it is imparitive for there to be a change in the way our government is opporating and most of the decisons made. Personally I voted for Obama and am  not afraid to admit this choice. Voting for president is about whats right for you and who will best carry out the opinions you have on certain issues. In no way am i saying that I know he ill be the best fit for our country and turn  everything around but at this stage in the game he has the capacity to do big things. Obama needs to grab the reins of these important issues. Such as jobs, healthcare and the financial crisis we as a nation find ourselves in and play a part in making a step towards the right direction.

Question 2

Section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act is not releivent in todays society. Newscasters broadcast the most popular stories, canidates and issues we as a nation are interested in. To me there is no fair treatment in media. Whatever story sells the most ratings and most copies will be the one most widely publicized. Media has a mind of its own and carries out the information that we demand. Not very many results were shown for other presidential canaidates that i had noticed but nor did i follow their capaigns either. The big ticket stories were Mccain and Obama and thats what the media most concentrated on when projecting results.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Reply to Week 11 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='66418'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Reply to Week 11 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='14-11-08 01:52:28'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226645548'/><attribute name='author' value='Carrie Dragicevic'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24846'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='307359'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree that a fine line has been drawn regarding freedom of speech in schools, and that it&apos;s not necessarily a good thing.

The main factor is the number of options that people have to watch on TV. People have so many options, that even when a show is popular, there are many things for people to watch. Therefore, even with an increase in viewers the people are distributed across a broader range. 

Advertisers may want information on the types of viewers that may be tuning in. For example, if an advertiser is trying to sell a sports product, they would want to advertise on shows where many sports fans tune in.

My favorite show on contemporary television is LOST. It is a show on ABC about a group of people stranded on a desert island trying to escape. It compares to the shows on list by it is a weekly show that is on. Each week a new challenge arises with the same characters. The main difference is LOST has a goal that the characters are constantly trying to achieve, where shows such as MASH and Beverly Hillbillies seem to be more random situations.

Television has played a huge role in this election. It is the main medium that candidates use to introduce themselves to the public and also voice their views. I think that the candidates going on late night comedy shows is a very smart political strategy. They are trying to relate to the people, especially the younger crowd. It gives people the feeling that they can relate to.

The clip included is John McCain on Letterman, where he recieved positive views for being funny and coming across as younger, making him more appealing to the voters.

Short Answers

    I believe that the reason a show has not made it onto the table&amp;rsquo;s list is due to the drastic decline of the network era.   Satellites and cable TV have also contributed to the decline of the network era; there are many more channels to choose from and a larger variety of shows. VCRs and DVRs also contribute to the decrease in viewers of a particular program.
    Besides ratings, advertisers want to know the financial status of viewers as well as the age group. Particularly the affluent 18-49 year olds.
    My favorite show on TV is Frasier. Although, you can only watch re-runs, it aired from &amp;rsquo;93-&amp;rsquo;04. The show won a record 37 Emmy Awards.  I think Frasier resembles most of the shows displayed in the table.  The show had a fairly long run and was quite successful. 

 
Television has played a large role in this election. Each party has spent millions of dollars in advertising. Some citizens choose their candidate based on TV advertisements. I think that candidates appear on late night comedy programs because they have such a large mature viewing audience.

With so many stations and competition for advertising dollars networks are forced to cater to the audiance that spends the most, that is why they want the financial status of the audiance. I think that it is important to reach the target audiance for the advertiser&apos;s products.

The reason that the shows  made on the list after fifteen years is because they are the shows that stood 
      for the ideals and thought process of  society. Shows that are aired on t.v. today are completely 
     different. There are so many more shows and sitcoms than there ever were, and with today&apos;s advanced 
     technological its extremely convenient.  The DVR and TiVo have made it easy to stay up to caught up         with any show you  wanted too, and back in the day with the shows people were not able to do that. So       the  shows were aired more and for longer period of time. 

2. Besides rating , advertisers look at the content and the marketing of the show. Advertisers may look at 
    how long the show lasts for , and the reasons behind the popularity of a particular show. Another thing the  advertisers may research on is if  a certain actor/ actress is really helping with the show and possibility of  using that actor/actress for maybe a new show/sitcom. 

3. I don&apos;t watch many shows, but one of my all time favorite shows is House , and Entourage along with      
    Law and Order SVU and CSI. I think these shows are completely modern and contemporary and reflect 
    today&apos;s society , while the shows on the graph express a completely old school concepts, which make    
   them still popular. I still every once in a while watch Cheers and MASH when it is on late at night. 

QUESTION 2: 

Television had the biggest impact on election because that is obviously the biggest most accessible and most informative. The candidates are able use t.v. as their outlet to the American people when it comes to discussing  issues. The appearances of the late night comedy shows was a good way to  communicate to the public in a memorable way and a humorous way.

Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

     I personally think that it has been almost 15 years since a TV series or show has made it onto that list because more people are watching Sports Programming such as football games and such and those vary by day... usually games are played anywhere from Wednesday to Sunday, depending on if it&apos;s College or Professional. I aslo think that people&apos;s lives have evolved and have more going on in them that prevents them from tuning into a show that is shown on a certain day and time. One other reason may be that people can fit watching those series into their schedule by watching them via the internet instead of live on Television.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 

     I think advertisers would want to know the age group of the audience for starters. I think they would also want to know the tendencies and possibly the interests of the viewer. For example, say the programming was a televised hockey game, then hockey retail format stores would be the most likely interested in showing commercials. Same for Beer companies, they tend to target sports programming because they feel this is the most marketable area for potential buyers of there product. 

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

     My favorite show on contemporary television would have to be Family Guy. This show compares to the shows listed in the graphic by being a comedy and having plots and characters most viewers can relate to. This show is cartoon version of somewhat real scenarios and making a comedy out of it. 

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

     I think Television has played a HUGE role in this election. I think that by going on certain television shows and late night talk shows produced positive publicity for the candidates by showing that they have real human characteristics and the audiences could relate to the candidate. I beleive both candidates Barack Obama and John McCain appeared on Saturday Night Live (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOSvXpFUHEw-- Fox News take on John McCain being on SNL) and in both cases I think it helped positivley support the candidates by making the audience feel more comfortable with them.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Evolution...

Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
I think it has been almost more than fifteen years since a television show made it to the list because no one is connected to television the way they used to be. Technology is changing and people are finding new sources, and means of communication. 
2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 
When looking for an effective audience, I think finding the right audience is what they are looking for. When making a new program finding the right age group, the right culture, and the right set of people is what you should think about, when it comes to audience. You want to thoroughly get the message across to your crowd. 

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
I find myself attracted to reality tv. For some reason all the other shows i used to watch, has been kind of tuned out. My favorite show on television right now is American Idle. I like to watch reality television.When I was younger I used to watch shows like Fresh Prince of Belle Air, and Family Maters, but now I am on reality TV , and it just really became popular though.  However, I find myself watching things on the internet more so than the television because I can find more things on the internet, and with the new TiVo you can watch as you want. 

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

Television was crucial to this election. They needed television to promote ads, and get the public informed with the candidates, as well as bashing the other candidates. They used all type of tactics to get the audience involved. They had debates, which needed to be aired across the country.  They used late night comedy shows because they wanted to get the audiences involved with the election. There are certain types of people that watch the late night shows, and to them involved, as well as the day time viewers, they had to use comedy and entertainment as an effective means to get the late night watchers involved, and enthused. I found a clip with Sarah Palin, It was so hilarious, and people talked about ti for days, all across the world. It was a Saturday Night Live clip, with Tine Fey.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
 
 
Well I believe the taste of T.V shows have changed in the last decade. Our generation is used to high drama or reality T.V shows like Prison break, Survivor, and American Idol. Also satellite and Cable TV programs like On Demand have played a major role resulting in the decrease of TV show ratings. Also government regulations and newer TV networks played a role in the decline of the network era.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience?
 
Advertisers would like to know what popularizes a show and how to make it a productive long lasting show, that can generate high rating year in and year out. They would also like to see how audiences relate to certain actors or actresses. They would also like to see what certain age groups relate to certain shows.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
 
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air! Hands down that is my favorite show. I know it&amp;rsquo;s a little old school dating back to the 1990s but to me it never gets old. I can watch it anytime. The humor is classic and I like how it relates to real like problems and family matters. The show is more of modern times compared to the list. It is also a show that draws a younger audience than that of the chart. It is more comical then most of the shows listed on the chart. 

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

With out a doubt Television has played a major role in this year&amp;rsquo;s election process. This was a historic election. Many big names were involved in campaigning for both parties. Both candidates appeared on SNL and other shows to show a different side. This has helped the people see the candidates in a different light. A more down to earth just like any other person sort of view became apparent on these shows. Also having a friendly laugh is a good way to gain favor in the eyes of the people. I expect future candidates to follow these measures in appearing on comedy programs.

Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

One possible reason for it being 15 years since a show made it on this list is because today and recently there has been much more variety offered then there was in the 1960&amp;rsquo;s. The choice of programs to watch was limited to a few stations whereas now there are hundreds to choose from. Also today people may use the internet as a form of entertainment as opposed to TV since we can pretty much find anything that was seen on TV on the internet.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience?

Besides ratings, advertisers might want to know demographics such as age, geographic location, gender, education, income, etc.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a favorite show on TV today since I don&amp;rsquo;t watch TV that much. However, when I do watch television I tend to watch more reality shows than anything. Reality shows differ from the shows listed above since the shows on the list have made up characters as well as no script.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

I think that television has played a great role in this election from Obama delaying the start of a World Series game to John McCain and Sarah Palin appearing on SNL. They are gaining coverage because of their actions. Television also played a great role when it comes to commercials. Not only have the Presidential candidates used commercials, I noticed state and local nominees have too as well. The commercials put out by the candidates deliver the message one of two ways: to encourage voters to vote for them or to put their opponent in a negative light.

When it comes to appearing on late night comedy programs, I think this was done to intrigue the younger generation. It has been said many times, that the younger generation&amp;rsquo;s votes are vital in this election. By having the candidates appearing on these late night comedy shows that are appealing to the younger crowd, it may get them more involved and informed when it comes to this year&amp;rsquo;s election. Also, since many adults usually get to bed later it may catch their attention also.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
I think that a show hasn&amp;rsquo;t made onto the list for almost fifteen years because people are just not getting addicted to shows as easy as they did before. Life gets in the way for many people and they are unable to just sit down and religiously watch a show, especially when that show is an hour long. Work is becoming less and less a 9 to 5 job like in earlier years and they just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to watch a television show every week. 

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 
Some advertisers might want to know the ages of the viewers, education background, and the demographic of the viewers so that they able to adapt the likings of a huge group of people. 

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
I really don&amp;rsquo;t have a favorite show on contemporary television because I basically just watch what is on. I have, however, become a fan of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy and Raising the Bar. Although they are not comedies like the listed shows, the fact that they both draw in huge audiences and can attract all sorts of people is very much similar to the shows on the list.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
Television played a pivotal role in this election. Obama made headlines because he spent the most money ever for a presidential candidate on his 30-minute infomercial later last month. 
And of course, Saturday Night Life was not a stranger when it came to portraying the candidates. And of course, Palin and McCain both actually appeared on the show to very high ratings. 
I think that the candidates makes appearances on late night comedy programs to attract the younger audience. The candidates know that the younger voters stay up late and tune in to their favorite &apos;late-night&amp;rdquo; show so to better associate with them, they appeared on them.

This chart most clearly demarks the order of popular T.V shows based on the highest viewer rate at the top of 10 shows of the which earned this right by being most watched since 1960. The episodes of these shows are rated based on the amounts of viewers who tuned in, with the Mash final episode being the most liked in february 28 of 1983, with 60.2 viewers watching.
Question 1: Short Answer Questions:
1. Reflected through this chart it appears that is has been almost 15 years since a show made it onto the list with it starting off in 1964 only to come to a complete hault and pick up again in the 1980&apos;s. I think the reason for this is because the 1970&apos;s attracted new interests with it being the hippie era and people seemed to be more interested in social realistic interactions rather than media based interactions. The viewer ratings most likely dropped during this time and as a result shows did not necessarily make it on the list.
2. Besides ratings, advertisers would want to know what the show pertained to such as audience effects and what such audiences it would interest and use this information to attract the particular audience. Also, the time of day in which the show airs might be a prime interest to advertisers.
3. Personally, I do not have time to watch television considering I have to balance school and
work, however when I get time and feel like being frivolous, I am personally interested in Gossip girl which is a television serious based in New York, one of my favorite cities, and is also a subsidiary of book series in which I used to read while in high school!
Question 2:
Television Has played a huge rolein this election because of the campaigning ads tha need to be aired as well as targeting audiences who are potential voters and earning the these particular votes. I feel that candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs only to show their &apos;fun&apos; side and to get in touch with the younger generations in order to send their message out and to capture the votes of these particular individuals.

               Initially, I honestly thought that it was very interesting and peculiar that a show had not made it onto the list for almost fifteen years, but than I thought about it and it made sense. After all, there are too many shows these days that are competing for the top position and are constantly in competition for being the most watched show on television. In fact, there are too many shows, so much so that not one particular show stuck out as the clear cut winner and fifty shows cannot all have the highest place in terms of ranking.  Advertisers generally want to know ratings of a show, but more importantly the target audience because that way they can determine what areas they can work on improving and enhancing and investing more money in and by the same token learn where they are losing their money in advertising that serves them no purpose or gains them no profit so they can cut their losses. My favorite show on contemporary television is F.R.I.E.N.D.S. , which I think is needless to say far from most of the shows on there the only show on there I would think to even begin to compare wit friends is Cheers since it was a comedy that focused on a group of friends. However, I think my show reaches out to a broader and more varied audience than the show Cheers.
               I think television has played an extreme role in the election it has provided people the opportunity to see the presidential nominees&amp;rsquo; debate about very important issues in order to get a better idea of who they wanted to vote for. It has helped provide an effective outlet in which both candidates were able to advertise either to promote themselves or demean their opponent. Television has been a key player in the election, there so that we would not miss a single touching speech or a candidate appearance on a late night comedy show, which they did in order to be more popular and show personality and so that they can tap into an audience they may have missed while campaigning in order to get their votes.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: F.R.I.E.N.D.S '/><attribute name='message_id' value='64757'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: F.R.I.E.N.D.S '/><attribute name='message_date' value='09-11-08 22:25:40'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226287540'/><attribute name='author' value='Michelle Slater'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Hi Neda,

You made me think about something else.  There are so many show on today than there was 15 years ago that the networks may no longer want to utilize this chart due to the fact that there are just too many shows to choose from and the time span a show stays on the air now a days isn&apos;t very long at all.

American Dad, family guy, futurama.  They are similar but not the same.

Having too many could be the very reason why there are no recent shows on the rating chart.  You pointed out something I haden&apos;t considered.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='64223'/></branch></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 10.

    I believe that there have not been any more recent shows on the list because of the development of cable television. Because people have more options to choose from, they are not forced into watching one of three television shows. I am not sure if this is figured into the numbers, but I wonder if the development of recording devices, such as VCR&amp;rsquo;s and DVR programs that allow people to watch the television shows later. 
    Advertisers for shows may want to know the demographics of the people who watch the shows. The main categories that the advertisers would want to know are the age group and the sex of the viewers of the shows that they are looking to advertise with. Now, with channels which are centered on a specific group of people, advertisers are more easily able to identify where they should be putting their marketing into. For example, there is a channel that is mostly aimed toward weddings and wedding planning, knowing the demographics of these viewers, advertisers for weight loss programs are most popular on this channel.
    My favorite show on contemporary television has to be &amp;lsquo;Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy&amp;rsquo;. I believe that compared to the shows on the chart &amp;lsquo;Grey&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; is much less family friendly. I wonder how well the promiscuous sex, binge drinking and lesbian doctors would have gone over in times past. Not only in the eighties and nineties, but especially back in the sixties, I do not think that the risqu&amp;eacute; storylines in &amp;lsquo;Grey Anatomy&amp;rsquo; would have gone over very well with the family friendly viewers.
    I think that television has played an enormous role in the election of 2008. I believe that without the television the election may not have turned out the way it did. This, to me, is because the younger generation finally realized that they needed to come out and vote, and the younger generation is known for being lazy, and not reading, instead having their information spoon fed to them through a box hanging on the wall. As for the candidates appearing on the late night shows, I believe that they do so to make themselves look more human, to relate them to the constituents with whom they are trying to get their vote.

I disagree that the antics of the doctors on Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy would not have been accepted before now. If you have ever watched shows like MASH, Dallas, etc. the comedies and dramas of those times were filled with soap opera-like scandals, sex and mishaps. The biggest difference between those shows and current programming is the graphic nature in the way they show every little detail unlike previous eras when everything was alluded to and the camera would drift off at the key moment. Also, as you mentioned, very rarely did you find any programming with central homosexual characters. Can you imagine the reaction to a show like Will &amp; Grace back in the 60&amp;rsquo;s or 70&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it would have gone over well.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='63885'/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 10.

Within the dates shown (mid 1960&apos;s) is when the television age really had begun in our history. The economy was doing well and as a part of the American dream, each household had a television set. Now with the television set being a newly innovated advancement in technolgy during the time as well as hit programs such as the Ed Sullivan show and the Beverly Hillibilies, more and  more people would relate to these programs especially the younger generation at the time, thus causing the TV to be a center attraction within a household. Not to mention it was a very important time in american culture in the mid 1960&apos;s and people began loosing sight of the radio to get their information and turned to the TV. As for shows such as MASH and Cheers, these shows marked the first shows of sitcoms and this drew a new audience to watch TV than the usual young audience. topics changed to more mature material rather than the &apos;teeny bop&apos; programs that were being shown in the 60&apos;s programs.
Short answers:
1- I think it has been over fifteen years since a show has made on the list because since the early 90&apos;s the TV line up has dramatically changed and become very diverse and competitive. There are shows now that reach to all sorts of audience and some are broadcasted simulatniously during others thus causing competion within programs and shows end up have a lower rating scale than what the ones on the list used to have.

2- besides ratings, advertisers might want to know the credentials that program has or is recongnized for having such as awards, actors, topic of interests etc. 

3-Because my daily schedule is usually filled throughout the day, I rarely have time to watch television. But nontheless, my favorite program right now would have to be America&apos;s Best dance Crew. even though this show is only into its second season, it is created by the makers of American Idol and has the same idea and concept. I guess because it compares to American Idol and the whole reality phase in television, I would say this program will probably reach the height of the ed Sullivan show being that it is what is currently interesting the majority of people watching Tv.
Television has played a crucial role in this election. The more a candidate was advertised and promoted or made an appearance the more his popularity rised. People can not know who a person is but when television actors promote or speeak of them, their ratings rise. The most famous of all inpersenations would have to be saturday Night Live. because they can imitate people and what they represent, people watchign can familiarize themselves with indiviuals just by watching the actors imitate, especially during this past election.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: television chart '/><attribute name='message_id' value='75827'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: television chart '/><attribute name='message_date' value='15-12-08 20:26:00'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1229390760'/><attribute name='author' value='Christina Ponder'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='As for shows such as MASH and Cheers, these shows marked the first shows of sitcoms and this drew a new audience to watch TV than the usual young audience. topics changed to more mature material rather than the &apos;teeny bop&apos; programs that were being shown in the 60&apos;s programs.

I found the chart very interesting. A few things in particular stand out first. One is that 8 out of 10 of the networks is CBS.  Another is that 6 out of 10 of the dates occurred in the year 1964.  Also, its important to notice a few other trends on this chart, one is that the Beatles first and second appearances are both on it. Another is that Beverly Hillbillies appears overall 4 times on the chart, and that 3 of the shows on the chart are there because it was the airing of a final episode. All these tiny details are a key reason the shows made it onto the chart.  
Question 1
I think it has been almost 15 years since any show appeared on the list because work hours have changed drastically and now with modern convinces like Ti-Vo people do not need to watch live TV in order to see the airing of the favorite episode.  People now work around the clock, and at the time(s) most TV shows air, people are either still at work, or commuting home, making it harder to be included in the audience.  Besides ratings advertisers probably want to know more specific demographics of an audience.  For example, age ground, gender, social class, and race.  All these play a key role in what advertisers decide to push. For example Saturday morning cartoons have advertisements for toys, happy meals, and other cartoons; this keeps the kids interest and gives them ideas of what to tell their parents they want.  If watching a Lifetime movie, you see more advertisements for feminine products, like shampoos, make up, lotions, candles etc.  The demographics of an audience are key to advertisers.  My favorite TV show would have to be Sex and the City.  Its different than the shows on the list because it is shown on a network that has to be subscribed to. People can&amp;rsquo;t get it for free like CBS. Also, most of the shows on the list were ones a general audience could watch. Sex and the City is targeted towards woman of a certain age group and social class status.  
Question 2
Television played a key role this election.  However, in some ways, I do feel it got out of hand. The media covered so many aspects, and there was almost an abundance of information from so many different sources that it made it difficult for uneducated people to tell the facts from the propaganda so heavily pushed by campaigning.  I think each election it gets worse.  As technology grows and changes, there becomes more ways to spread information.  Now more people than ever have cell phones. Also, now these phones are connected to the internet.  People can get news and information on the election 24/7.  Either through cell phones, computers, or their television: it&amp;rsquo;s become increasingly easy for advertisers to reach people.  That was more noticeable this election. So, yes, television was important this election, mostly become more people have television than any other source of communication; however I think other sources, such as the internet may have been equally important this election.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Advertising &amp; Campaigning'/><attribute name='message_id' value='64199'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Advertising &amp; Campaigning'/><attribute name='message_date' value='07-11-08 22:46:29'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226115989'/><attribute name='author' value='Shannon Reeves'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Question 1: Short Answer Questions

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
I think there are quite a few factors that have contributed to it being more than a decade since a show has made it on the list.  The first being the popularity of cable television and the sheer number of shows that are available to watch at any given time.  With the number of options available, it is difficult to get such a large audience to tune in and remain loyal to any particular show.  In addition to competition being a factor, I think as Americans we&amp;rsquo;ve lost the tradition of gathering as a family around the television.  It seems that we are busier than ever with so many different demands that families can&amp;rsquo;t get together around the TV, let alone eat dinner together!

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 
Advertisers want to know the demographics of the audience that will be watching the programming. For example you&amp;rsquo;ll find countless advertisements for children&amp;rsquo;s food and toys during children&amp;rsquo;s programming hours.  You&amp;rsquo;ll find advertisements that cater to stay-at-home moms or unemployed people during the day (for the unemployed, learn a skill at home courses and the like).  You also find products advertised for different races depending on the races of the actors in the show.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
Well, as mentioned previously there are so many to choose from!  I guess since this is a forced choice ; ) I&amp;rsquo;ll choose The Office.  I always seem to find myself watching it and either laughing out loud or shaking my head.  I work in an office situation myself and I am a manager; the situations they portray are quite funny to me because they are so politically incorrect and would not go on (without punishment of sort) in an ordinary office.  There are some edgy conversations where I work but most employees are cognizant of what they are saying and do their best (for the most part) not to be offensive.  With The Office, there are no rules basically, and no topic is off limits.
Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
It seems as the years go by and more elections come and go, the mudslinging gets worse and worse.  Aside from the negative ads, the candidates are participating in a lot more &amp;lsquo;mainstream&amp;rsquo; programming such as Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. I think a major factor in this being the case during this election is that Tina Fey look so similar to Sarah Palin! Based on that, John McCain also had to go on SNL and in order to &apos;keep up with the Jones&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;, so to speak, Barack Obama had to make a &amp;lsquo;mainstream&amp;rsquo; appearance. I think the actual start of this was with the youtube videos of the girls singing about Barack Obama. With so many media outlets, why not make fun of yourself to the national public and possibly gain the vote of someone who would normally vote, or necessarily vote for your party!'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Television'/><attribute name='message_id' value='64180'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Television'/><attribute name='message_date' value='07-11-08 21:27:42'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226111262'/><attribute name='author' value='Salam Makki'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='
I think there are two main reasons why shows today are not making it on the list...first, the introduction of the DVR has made it very easy for people to watch their favorite show anytime they want (what the book described as time shifting)....I don&apos;t think i have actually watched one of my favorite TV shows at the time it actually airs.  To be honest, if I happen to be home during primetime and I want to watch something, I will actually wait for it to record first just so I could avoid the commercials. So the ratings aren&apos;t there.  Second, the variety and number of TV shows on today differs from many years ago.  Everyone loved MASH back then not just because it was a great show but there wasn&apos;t many options.

Advertisers would want to know the age group, gender, location, etc.  For advertisers its not just about ratings and how many people watch but whether or not their product is marketable to certain demographics.

My favorite show is Greys Anatomy and ER..final season:(   And to be completely honest, I love reruns or shows in syndication.  My favorite of course is Friends...I have no idea why that  show never made it on the list.  Its one of the greatest shows that was ever created.  It has to be the DVR technology cuz it is an injustice.  I think its very comparable to the shows that are listed..if not better.  (Thats my opinion anyway).

Television has played a huge role in the election.  Show creators will use the popularity of their shows to express their political opinion to large audiences.  The large audiences also allow for political candidates to show their personable side vs. just the politics where its hard to connect.  Television allows candidates to reach out to voters on  a personal level.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Television '/><attribute name='message_id' value='64764'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Television '/><attribute name='message_date' value='09-11-08 22:45:02'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226288702'/><attribute name='author' value='John Griffith'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='What a great invention the DVR is.

Looking at the chart above of The Top 10 Highest- Rated TV Series the most recent series on that list is Cheers, a series which aired in 1994 almost 15 years ago.  I think that the reason that it has been that long since another series has made it on that list is because TV is not what it used to be.  There are many shows out there that the competition for viewer loyalty is hard to capture and hold on too.
     TV has also evolved in a positive way; it has become a means to reach people in ways that were never done before.  In this past presidential election both candidates relied heavily on TV advertisements as well as making appearances on various television programs; this was done in an effort to connect with the American people. Many times these tactics proved to be a good way to promote a candidate and at other times they seemed to hurt that candidates rating. Polls are always taken throughout a political campaign to try and gauge the American public&amp;rsquo;s opinion and to try and predict an outcome. Most of us are familiar with the infamous interview that Sarah Palin had with Katie Couric in which the vice presidential candidate stumbled and was criticized for her lack of knowledge.   This is an example of how sometimes the use of television can hurt a political candidate.

I think that is has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list because the changing of times, the new generation isn&amp;rsquo;t really interested in good quality shows such as the ones on this list. These kinds of shows are boring, slow and don&amp;rsquo;t reflect what is happening today. While Reality TV is a big hit, no one is interested in sitting at home watching a TV Series especially a family one. Also, I believe Cable plays a very big part in why no shows have made it on the list. Cable TV offers over 200 channels with old and new shows, and shows in other countries. This gives viewers a wider choice to choose from and it lowers the ratings on new shows because there&amp;rsquo;s such a variety to choose from, where as 15 years ago this wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.
Another reason is because nowadays people are busy, busy working, going to school or just leading a very hectic life style, that they don&amp;rsquo;t have any time to sit down and watch a TV Series.
Lastly, DVD&amp;rsquo;s and Videos weren&amp;rsquo;t as popular as they are today. Many times people will go out and rent a movie if they&amp;rsquo;re going to be at home relaxing instead of watching a TV series. This is why the few TV shows we do have come out don&amp;rsquo;t last very long. The ratings go up and in a few years the ratings drop tremendously. Look at how fast the show All of Us, produced by Will and Jada Smith. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that show lasted 3 seasons.
2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience?
Advertisers would want to know about the Demographics such as Gender, Race, Age, the locations of the audience and the times the show is going to be airing in each location. This is important to them because advertisers would need to know exactly what products would be good to advertise on that show, during a particular time of day.
3. What is your favorite show on contemporary Television?  My Favorite show is CSI Miami, AC360, Larry King on CNN, Cold Case files, and all wedding shows.
How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic? In today&amp;rsquo;s society, many people are interested in watching shows with profanity in it, sexual contents and violence in it. None of the shows in the graphic had any of these in them. Again, changing of the times and what is allowed on Television today oppose to what was allowed on Television 15 years ago.
Question 2: 
What role has television played in this election?   Television has played a major role in this election. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say Television is what helped people make a decision on who they want to vote for. Television was the main vehicle that allowed us into every area of the life of the candidates and their families.
Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs?   The candidates had appearances on late night comedy programs because this helped Voters to see them in a different way, more of a relaxed setting yet we got to see the humor in them.

Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?  
a) There are a few reasons why it has been almost 15 years since a show made        it to this list.
b)     People are busier and do not watch as much TV.
c)     People spend a lot of time on the internet and not watching TV
d)       Many shows are on the &apos;Demand&amp;rdquo; on cable and over the internet
e)       The younger generation that used to watch a lot of TV is more into video games and others from of entertainment.
f)          e)Most TV shows are sold in DVD and come out very quickly as soon as the season finishes.  The DVD allows viewers to sit down and watch the whole season in one sitting.
2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 
Advertisers will like to know the age demographics of the viewers and how much they spend monthly on products and merchandise. 

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
I have many contemporary shows that I watch; one of my favorites is MASH. The final episode is number one on the list.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
a)    Television played a large role in this election, but I believe other technologies i.e. Internet, email and text messaging had a larger impact in the out come of the election.
b)    The reason candidates appear on late night shows is to use it as free advertisement. In the case of Governor Palin, her appearance on SNL showed that she is a good sport and it also brought a lot of exposure to the campaign that was free.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know who was the first candidate to appear on late night shows, but I remember Bill Clinton during the 92 campaigned appearing on the Arsenio Hall show playing the saxophone. 
http://www.arseniohall.com/sounds/arseniohall_clinton-plays-sax_300k.wmv

 
 

 

 

 

 

  
From usefultrivia.com &apos;During the 1992 Presidential Campaign, Bill Clinton made a surprise appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show -- wearing dark sunglasses, he played &apos;Heartbreak Hotel&apos; on his saxophone. At the time, he was trailing in the polls, and some critics have suggested that this appearance captured the imagination of the American people and turned the race around. In the end, Clinton carried 43 percent of the vote, easily defeating George Bush and Ross Perot and making him the forty-second President of the United States of America.&amp;rdquo;

Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
 
I believe that it has been almost fifteen years since a show has made it onto the list because of the technology advancements. Cable and satellite television gives people a wide variety of television shows, compared to television in the past.  

2.      Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 
 
Advertisers would most likely be interested in knowing the demographics of the audience. Some of the demographics that would be used are sex, race, religion, and education. Knowing the demographics of the audience can help advertisers decisions on the audience that there programs will target.

3.       What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic? 
 
I myself will have to admit that I like some reality shows. Even though I know that majority of it is scripted, and they are all kind of similar, I am still a fan of them. But one of my favorite regular shows on contemporary television is Degrassi. I have been watching Degrassi since there first season, and they are now in their eighth season. I believe Degrassi is a very relatable to today&amp;rsquo;s youth. I do not think that Degrassi really compares to the shows listed on the chart. Yes it has been on a long time, but it has not been on as long as the shows on the chart.  Also, I do not think the amount of viewers compares to the shows on the chart. 

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
 
Television has played a major role in this year&amp;rsquo;s election. Besides the internet, television is one of the most common ways that people usually get their information.  Television can be used to persuade people, and for the election, it is all about persuading voters. I think that the candidates made appearances on late night comedy programs to show a more light hearted representation of themselves.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 10 Assignment'/><attribute name='message_id' value='63318'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 10 Assignment'/><attribute name='message_date' value='05-11-08 13:57:28'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225911448'/><attribute name='author' value='Carrie Dragicevic'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I hadn&apos;t thought about religion influencing advertisers, but that&apos;s a very good point!

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
   There are two major causes that have prevented viewership to be so concentrated on one specifick show, greater diversity and the internet.  Greater diversity speaks to the endless amounts of new channels that appeal to various niches. There are so many channels it is just amazing to think how people use to survive. Back in the times of the shows listed above, there were far less options than the ones availible today.  More recently the continued development of the internet has allowed shows to be broadcast via streams to computer just like television. I know I use websites like hulu to watch many shows I miss.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience?
  The demographic.  In advertising and marketing, knowing who your target group is and find a way to reach them is very important.  If a marketing firm finds a television show that is popular with their target demographic for a certain product or service, they will try their hardest to get their ad on during that show.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
  One of my favorite shows on modern television is 24.  It wa very popular toward the early seasons becuase of the action/suspence and the concept of episodes being in real time. Although I have never seen an episode of Dallas, I have heard that the two are very similar.  I don&apos;t really see any other similarities with the other shows listed.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
  Television has played a huge in this election as it has since JFK and Nixon in the early 60&apos;s.  Television allows candidates to reach out to the masses unlike before. It also allows to American people to identify with the candidates can see them and here them and put the two together. The appearances on the late night tv shows this year was great.  I talked about it in a previous post.  I feel that Barack originaly did it because younger people identify with him much more than McCain, and it was something that the younger voting generations would appreciate.  When McCain made his appearances, it was more of a responce to Barack going on the show.

I agree with your view here on media and the Presidential candidates. I like the fact that this form of media can enable the candidates to somewhat relax and show their true personalities like they both were [somewhat] able to on Saturday Night Live. I also agree with Obama doing it to conect to the younger crowd and hopefully make his image similar to JFK&apos;s with the &apos;youth&apos; aspect.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

I would think it has been almost 15 years because of the variety in today&apos;s society regarding television shows.  Also there is a TON of channels on television today whereas in 1964 there was only 10-20% of the channels.  Cable wasn&apos;t around so it was all over the air programming.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 

Demographics, age, location, sex, race.  All of these can be used in conjuction with new shows to see what works and what does not.  Each of these are very important in my opinion.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

I enjoy Family Guy and Futurama.  These are both on Cartoon Network (Adult Swim) late at night (11pm).  Definitly geared towards the older crowd (17-25) I would guess.  Both these shows have been on a while but still can not touch the above shows.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

Television is the gateway for the candidates to get their points across.  Whether through commercials, infomercials, late night shows, debates and the similar.  ALOT of money has been spent in advertising.  I think late night comedy programs have helped as it captures a somewhat older crowd.  A 14 year old isn&apos;t watching Jay Leno as they &apos;should&apos; be in bed.  A 14 year old can&apos;t vote so it does not much matter.  I chose a video from Jay Leno and the Tonight Show with Barack Obama.  Jay just quizzed Barack with questions regarding his campaign but I think it was a worthwhile showing.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

I think that there are many factors that result in a single show not being as popular today as it was years ago:

Years ago there were less options when it came to entertainment. 
The quantity of TV stations and TV shows were less. 
Cable was not as popular (if at all in existance) as it is today. 
Other forms of entertainment: theater, video games, computers were not cost effective and/or not around
more and more families have had both adults working, single parents working 1-2 jobs....less time

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 

Advertisers would want to know what the demographics of the viewers are: how old are they? gender? single? married? kids? what location do they live in? ethniticity? All of these factors are important to choose the correct commercials for the program time. A Charmin commercial may work well during day time soaps, but not so well during the evening news. Why? Example - Women (core shoppers) tend to watch day time soaps more then the bread winners. The men tend to tune into the evening news, after work, each day and they are not the largest group of core shoppers.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

My favorite show is The Office. It is on during prime time, and on one of the busiest prime time show nights. It is funny (in my pov,) but there is so much competition on TV I am sure not as many people choose this show as they do others. 

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

The candidates have been on tv doing debates, conducting interviews on news stations, not to forget about thier wonderful commercial ads promoting themselves and tearing down thier opponents, and appearing on late night comedy.  In regards to late night comedy programs, the following clip shows that there have been some studies done that experts believe the comedy programs do sway the listeners voting decisions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6E-nIobrI
Most of the jokes have been on the Republican Campaign, and I can see how that would influence a voter&apos;s decision not to vote for the laughing stock.

There are so many examples of guest appearances, so I decided to pull just two: Letterman with O&apos;Bama and Letterman with McCain:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkM66VEfJYk
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIEbk3tIRVQ

There is a huge difference in the tone of both interviews. O&apos;Bama&apos;s intererview was more serious in nature. Humor was mostly from O&apos;bama, not directed from Letterman. McCain&apos;s interview with Letterman starts differently, because McCain did not appear on a pervious show committment. Letterman asks about many of McCain&apos;s decisions, which have been often joked about, Joe the Plumber, William Ayers and accusastions of relationships between him and O&apos;Bama, Gordon Liddy, Palin, and puts him on the spot regarding a &apos;plan.&apos; Letterman spends a lot of time drilling McCain on his VP choice, he doesn&apos;t do the same with O&apos;Bama. McCain spends a lot of time defending her in this clip. Letterman even starts talking over McCain near the end of the interview. This difference, even in the interviews, have to have some influence, even sub-consciencely, on the public.

There&amp;rsquo;s also a lot more to do these days than watch television. Nearly everyone has Internet access.  As was mentioned earlier in the semester, many people spend far more time on the Internet today than watching television.  We also have countless video games for kids to entertain themselves with.
I think work hours for many families have also increased, taking away from the wind-down time when many relax and watch TV.  We also have easy access to DVDs and On-Demand movies and shows.
Besides ratings, advertisers will want to know exactly what type of person is watching the show. Audience age, race, gender, education level, etc. all affect what types of products appeal to them. For example, on MTV, you don&amp;rsquo;t see commercials for life insurance because the average viewer is a teenager or young adult who isn&amp;rsquo;t remotely interested in life insurance. Instead, you see ads encouraging you to text a number and see if your crush likes you &amp;ndash; something teenagers may do, but not busy working mothers.
My favorite show (an American television, anyway) is House.  For the most part, the list seems to be made up of half-hour sitcoms (including Friends and Seinfeld) whereas House is an hour-long medical &amp;lsquo;dramady&amp;rsquo; that mixes medical mystery with comedy.  It&amp;rsquo;s also a psychological character study of the thoroughly messed-up Dr. House.  I think House asks the viewers to think more about the plot and the characters, whereas sit-coms let the audience just sit back and relax, which is probably more appealing to many viewers.
I think television had a huge impact on the election. I mentioned last week that Obama appearing on Ellen made him seem more relatable, which really appeals to many people, especially younger voters.  Appearing on late night comedy talk shows has the same effect. It reaches a different audience than CNN and the newspapers, an audience that may not care about watching debates or going to rallies.  There&amp;rsquo;s also the Tina Fey/Sarah Palin SNL skits, which made her seem dumb and ditzy, turning her into a laughing stock.  Those skits definitely had an impact on some voters.
Here is a clip from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, in which Stewart interviews Obama.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2cBLdaEywa'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 10, Assign. 1 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='63644'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 10, Assign. 1 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='06-11-08 10:59:53'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225987193'/><attribute name='author' value='Vanisha Patel'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree that the media is the biggest influence for the american people whe it comes to the election.

Well, so what? What&apos;s wrong with a president in a wheelchair? Being bombarded with the candidates&apos; images constantly adds a new variable to the equation. Now, we want pretty people to run the country. People always focused on Palin&apos;s good looks and beauty queen status. Obama, like many before him, is an attractive guy.  

Since we can see them all the time, people are also concerned with things like how often they made eye contact with the camera during the debates.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list? I think it has been almost fifteen years since a show has made it onto the list because of the drastic change in television. Fifteen years ago television did not have half as many channels as we do today and there was also no DVRs or TiVos. Fifteen years ago everyone had to sit down and choose out of a couple of shows to watch and actually watch it at the time that it aired. Nowadays there are so many shows on and you can choose to watch them whenever you want to.
2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? Advertisers might want to know what kind of audience is watching. For example they might want to know if a show&amp;rsquo;s audience is for teenagers, women, men, adults, children and probably even race. Advertisers want to know this about their audience so they can advertise the correct products for the audience instead of wasting money on something that will serve no purpose to advertise. 

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic? I would say my favorite television show is Prison Break. I would say this show has way more violence than any of the shows listed. I am not sure I have ever watched the Fugitive but my guess is that Prison Break has more violence and more adult content than that show as well. 

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible. I would say that television has played a huge role in this election. Television allows everyone to see what the candidates are about by watching their speeches, the debates and so on. It allows the people to learn more about the candidates instead of just reading what they would like to do if elected. I think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy because it gains a different audience. Late night comedy might appeal more to someone than the debates and speeches would so these people can learn about their candidates as well.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

I believe that one of the biggest reasons that it has been so long since a show has made the list is because there are so many more shows on t.v. today.  With the emergence of reality t.v. and a wide variety of new television stations there are too many options on these days for people to choose from.  Thus the more options people have, the more spread out the ratings are going to be.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience?

Advertiser should pay attention to the age group that the show is directed at.  If it&apos;s a show that teens and young adults are watching, the advertisement should be different from the shows that maybe the 50+ crowd is watching.  Also the time slot of the show is important.  If a show is airing at 11pm as opposed to 8pm then you might have two very different types of audiences.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

I have three favorite shows on t.v. and they are: &apos;The Office&apos;, &apos;Southpark&apos;, and &apos;It&apos;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&apos;.  I dont believe these shows compare at all to the shows listed above.  Each of the shows that I am watching have a certain type of &apos;dumb&apos; or &apos;immature&apos; comedy to them.  That being said, I still really like each show.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

I think that television played the biggest role of all in this election and in most previous elections.  For most people, seeing the candidates on t.v. is the only way that they will have an idea of what each stands for.  I also think that the candidates would agree with this as well, just look at how much money is put into advertising each election.
I think that candidates appear on late night comedy programs for a couple reasons.  The first is because they know that those audiences can have a lot of young independent voters that they are trying to win over.  The second reason is because they are trying to show everyone that they also have a personal side to them as well.  They laugh just like you and I do, and that makes them seem more real.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Television '/><attribute name='message_id' value='63758'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Television '/><attribute name='message_date' value='06-11-08 15:06:56'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226002016'/><attribute name='author' value='Lauren Madison'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='THE MOST IMPORTANT PART ABOUT TELEVISION AND THE CANDIDTES WAS BEING ABLE TO WATCH THE DEBATES.

I believe that this election was decided by the younger generations of voters who finally came out to get their voice heard. In an ideal World this younger generation would have watched the debates and made their decisions based on the issues at hand. But I believe that had they watched the debates or not this generation, which made the election go the way it did, would not have been swayed the other way had they watched the election. I believe that President Elect Obama spoke to this generation in a way that John McCain and none before him could ever even understand how to do. So, yes I believe that the television had a great role in the outcome of the election, as it was a means at which Obama was able to get his message out, but I do not think that the debates had much to do with anything because it was, I believe, the experienced voters who watched these. But the experienced voters were not the ones who decided this election.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='63477'/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 10 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='63064'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 10 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='04-11-08 19:14:35'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225844075'/><attribute name='author' value='Carly Tobin'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

I think it has been quite some time since a show has made it onto that list because of how drastically television has changes since then.  There are many more different channels and shows for people to watch now than the limited number of television shows offered years ago.  The way people watch tv has evolved as well.  With the advance in technology people can now chose from thousands of different tv shows or movies at any time of the day.  With TiVo and DVR people can tape shows which affects the ratings.  Also, people can now view full television episodes from their computer instead of watching the episode when it airs live for the first time on tv.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 

Advertisers would want to know things like age and gender of the show&apos;s audience so that they can aim their ad&apos;s at things that people of the certain demographic are intersted in.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary televsion? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

Although it no longer airs new episodes, my favorite show is Friends.  It relates to the shows above, it is a sitcom that was on NBC, and had pretty wide spread popularity.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

Television has played a large role in this elections, with all of the campaign ads (positive and negative), the debates, and the constant news coverage updating viewers on the campaign.  I think candidats have had appearances on late night comedy programs because they are trying to reach out to a different audience that maybe doesn&apos;t watch the 6 o&apos;clock news, or CNN.  I think sometimes they are trying to reach out to the younger crowd and show maybe a lighter side of their personality.  I have a clip that isn&apos;t from a late night comedy show, it is from the Ellen show.  I am including this video because this is an example of Barak Obama trying to show a lighter side of his personality to the audience.  He is shown dancing with Ellen in the beginning.

Question 1: Short Answer Questions

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
As depicted in the reading, There was a time when  CBS, NBC, and ABC dominated prime-time programming. These networks accounted for more than 95 percent of prime-time viewing.  These were the free shows that EVERYONE watched, so they have become classics. I think that with the development of cable, it allowed viewers to expand their choices and find a show that better suited their interests. Also explained in the reading, by 2005, the percentage of viewers of CBS, NBC, and ABC  dropped to below 45 percent because of technological changes, governmental regulations, and the development of new networks. There are now so many new networks that have been developed that concentration on a couple of shows has spread thin.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience?
Advertisers would also like to know what kind of audience each show is targeted to, so they can advertise related commercials to grab the viewer&amp;rsquo;s interest. They have to find out what is important and popular to a certain audience.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
As odd as this may sound, I rarely watch television at all. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what airs right now. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit more of an active person. But bat on the statistics and readings, pretty much every contemporary show airing now will have much lower ratings. I did used to watch America&apos;s Next Top Model a bit, a top-rated contemporary program, and it is noted that the series drew 5-6 million viewers per week compared to the 20-30 million reached by the most highly rated network programs.  So I am applying that statistic... or lower to the majority of other programs being created, then cancelled on television.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
Television I believe molds a lot of people&amp;rsquo;s views in their effort s of educating. Especially FOX network. It proves to be very influential in helping citizens make their candidate decision. I think that candidates have made appearance on late night comedy programs to make themselves look &apos;human&amp;rdquo; and relatable. John McCain made an appearance on SNL this past weekend&amp;mdash;despite their constant mockery of him.

As depicted in the reading, There was a time when  CBS, NBC, and ABC dominated prime-time programming. These networks accounted for more than 95 percent of prime-time viewing. There were not many televison shows around at that time, and with Television being a newer technology, families HAD to have them and most integrated them into family tradition.

I think that with the development of cable, it allowed viewers to expand their choices and find a show that better suited their interests. In turn many viewrs turned to channels that sparked their interests a bit more.

Demographics. Advertisers would also like to know what kind of audience each show is targeted to, so they can advertise related commercials to grab the viewer&amp;rsquo;s interest.

1.                  Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
I think it has been so long since a show made the list because of the amount of different shows that are on TV now. With more people having cable and satellite programming there are many more options for people to watch. They have so much variety where as in the past people had only Over the Air (OTA) programming available. Back then, they would have had less than 10 options of what to watch on TV. A greater amount of the viewers would be watching the few options that were available.

Advertisers need to consider their intended audience in order for their advertisement to be effect. Therefore, demographics such as age group, gender, and average income need to be taken into consideration.
3.                  What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
I would have to say Southpark is my favorite show on TV. Southpark is much different from any of the shows on the list. Southpark is on cable. It is also a cartoon aimed at an older age group that can be found offense by many people.
Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.
Outside of the debates on TV, television has not played much of a role for me in the election. For many people it has given them much more exposure to the candidates. In addition, news stations constantly talk about the election, so TV has made coverage very available for people looking for more information on the election.
I think candidates have made appearance on late night comedy shows for more exposure. A different audience is seeing them and the candidates are showing they have personalities.

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?

Sitting down together in front of the television as a family is no longer an American tradition. Now, we live in a world with too many other choices on the television or ways to entertain ourselves. When I was growing up there were only six channels to choose from (2, 4, 7, 20, 50, 56 and 62), which did not amount too many options, plus there were not video games to play or the internet to surf. Nowadays, there is too much competition out there with the 100&amp;rsquo;s of channels featuring a wide variety for one show to capture almost the whole market.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 

I think that advertisers would want to know the demographic, ethnic background, income and typical household information. Advertisers can then market their product to the specific audience. For example, Ford would not want to promote the super heavy duty F-300 truck during a show like Desperate Housewives because the audience is predominantly women. A smarter bet would be to promote their smaller cars and/or the features and benefits of their mini-vans.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?

So hard to choose just one&amp;hellip;would have to say, So You Think You Can Dance or Bones for me, and Extreme Makeover: Home Edition as a family show. The biggest difference is that two of them are reality shows, which are a more recent addition to television programming. Regarding Bones, one of the reasons I love the show is the character development and dialogue between them, which I think is very similar to the shows listed in the chart and what made them so popular. The difference would be the very graphic visual effects of the subject matter (forensic anthropology is very gross) compared to the almost cheesy special effects of that earlier era of television and the fact that every detail is shown now instead of just being eluded at. 

Question 2: 

What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

As I mentioned in last week&amp;rsquo;s assignment, I think the candidates are trying to appeal to a younger, more diverse audience than the typical primetime debate viewer that tunes in to hear how the candidates are planning to confront the issues. They want to call attention to their lighter, more approachable side. Let the viewers know that they are more than just a &apos;stuffed shirt.&amp;rdquo; What&amp;rsquo;s more likeable than a presidential or vice-presidential candidate (particularly a Republican one) that knows how to laugh at himself (or herself). I think too much of what leaves an impression in the mind of American voters is the overall nature of the publicity surrounding the candidate, especially when it provides intrigue and entertainment.

I thought this clip of David Letterman&amp;rsquo;s monologue dedicated to bashing, then praising John McCain for cancelling his appearance on the show was a wonderful example of how an appearance, or lack thereof, can influence voter&amp;rsquo;s perceptions. I can easily see how the public might form a negative or positive impression from Dave&amp;rsquo;s account, but either way, by not being on the show, McCain received more media attention than with his actual appearance.

Besides ratings, advertisers may want to know the background of the audience. This includes ethnic, economical and moral standards. They may also want to know the geographical location of the viewer if they are advertising climate related products such as snow blowers or flood insurance. The advertisers may also want to know the gender of the viewers and develop ways to initiate the target consumer without offending others. 
 
My favorite show on contemporary television is Judge Judy. This is a reality/court show with a sharp tongued mature judge. She tells it like it is all of the time and takes a no nonsense approach to small claims cases. For the most part, when the shows in the chart were on reality shows, other than game shows, were not around. The only court show was The People&amp;rsquo;s Court and was far more subdued than Judge Judy. Modern day reality shows involve real people in real life situation and is usually unscripted. The shows that are measured on this chart are totally scripted and may depict real life situations; the roles are played by actors and actresses and rarely involved the people whom may have been mimicked on the television sets around the world.

Whether that be online or by using their TiVo. Today, there are so many different ways of viewing programs that the original air date is insignificant.

2.)Advertisers want to know when their demographic would be most available to watch their program. If they know their target group thats one side of the story but if the audience is not home to tune in the radings fall. Advertisers also would like to know how to access their target audience through media advertisement whether that be online, TV or print.

3.) One of my favorite shows is Nip/Tuck. This program has been on a few years and has a huge viewer volume. My show does not compare hardly at all to the shows listed above its a lot more controversial and to me more enticing to a viewer of this day and age. My show appeals to an Adult audience and the shows above at that time required the same during that time.

Ques 2
Television has played a huge role in the election through advertisments, debates and simple talk from newscasters. Television has been the contributor to the canidates ideas and voice. Candidates have appeared on late night programs to help reach other types of audiences. By approaching late night TV it helps them to get their ideas across and even to get their name out there to an audience not normally tuning in.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Reply to week 10 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='63897'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Reply to week 10 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='06-11-08 22:15:04'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226027704'/><attribute name='author' value='Kristine McCurry'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Great point!

1. Why do you think that it has been almost fifteen years since a show made it onto the list?
In the past 15 years, TV has become less popular among people, especially those in younger generations.  There are more activites and technologies to occupy time, and sometimes the not-as-fun-or-entertaining TV takes a back seat to them.  15+ years ago, the TV was a main source of entertainment.  Families sat down together after dinner and watched their 2 hours of TV for the day, then the kids went to bed, and parents stayed up and watched shows like M*A*S*H and Cheers, which made them want to watch their final episodes.

2. Besides ratings, what else might advertisers want to know about a show&apos;s audience? 
Advertisers may want to know the ages, genders, and ethinicities of their viewers so they have an idea where they should advertise.

3. What is your favorite show on contemporary television? How does it compare to the shows listed above in the graphic?
My favorite shows include MLB Baseball, The Office, and Big Brother.  These shows don&apos;t really compare to those listed in the graphic at all.  They&apos;re different types of entertainment than the most popular ones in the chart.

Question 2: What role has television played in this election? Why do you think candidates have had appearances on late night comedy programs? Include video clips if possible.

I think people stay up later now than they used to.  We pack our days with constant activity, and by the time we get home to relax, it&apos;s time for the late night shows.  Sarah Palin&apos;s appearance on SNL and Barack Obama&apos;s interview with Conan O&apos;Brien were definitely new to people.  We&apos;re not used to seeing political candidates on late night shows, and that, for some people, was the only time they saw the candidates on TV.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 10 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='64634'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 10 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='09-11-08 17:06:04'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1226268364'/><attribute name='author' value='Roberto Morales'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value=' Good point Amanda, I never thought about the piece where some people only got to see the candidates on late night shows because of our busy schedules.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='64195'/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='reply'/><attribute name='message_id' value='68337'/><attribute name='message_title' value='reply'/><attribute name='message_date' value='19-11-08 17:04:33'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1227132273'/><attribute name='author' value='Renise Taylor'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24686'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='304488'/><attribute name='message_body' value='

Top Ten TV Series &amp; TV Influence Reply
It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly 15 years since a show has made it onto the list because of the internet, cable and satellite television.  You can view the most hilarious, outrageous and obscene media on the Internet at any given time at any time you please. Why would anyone sit around for a particular show that&amp;rsquo;s mild in regards of content compared to what they can view on the Internet at their leisure? And after all, YouTube is so much more interesting.
They might want to know about the interest of the audience such as hobbies or leisure activities. An advertiser may want to find out what other forms of media the audience members like to utilize besides the television. They also might benefit from knowing information such as income bracket and education level.
My favorite show contemporary TV are Martin (syndicated), A Different World (syndicated), The Parkers (syndicated) and The Game (UPN Network). These shows are different from the ones on the list because the main characters are African-American whereas the main characters of the listed shows are Caucasian.
Television has played a critical role in this election. These candidates are not just competing for votes as much as they are ratings. This election is comparable to that of the high school mock election. It is somewhat a popularity contest but hopefully the &amp;lsquo;high road&amp;rsquo; that Obama has chosen to take will prevail over all the juvenile mudslinging of the Republican Party and its presidential candidate.

The content and restrictions of television programs 15 years ago have been modified compared to that of today. Also the demographics of viewers have changed as we enter into the Generation X/Y era. The programs listed in the chart were popular amongst the baby boomers that are now either retired, or deceased.
 
Advertisers need to understand the psychographics of its viewers and what truly matters to them. They would want to know what would stimulate viewers and maintaining their attention.

The 2008 Elections were greatly influenced by the media and I believe played a valued part although destructive to the republican party. The satire played by Saturday Night Live (SNL) of that of Vice Presidential hopeful (but failed) Sarah Palin. They did a fantastic job of portraying the inexperience and &apos;not equipped for the job&apos; for Vice President. Sarah Palin also made a guest appearance on the show possibly in an attempt to defend her knowledge base which didn&apos;t work in my opinion but only gave the media more fuel to criticize and sway the general public.

Attached you will find the infamous anThatd very humorous FOX report on Sarah Palin not understanding that Africa was a Continent...that might be something a VP should know for future reference!

1.  I think that its been fifteen years since a show has made it onto this list because there is such a diversity of shows now.  In the times of these shows there were very little shows available to specific audiences.  

2.  Advertiser&apos;s would want to know the type of audience watching.  Male or female, young or old.  Advertiser&apos;s may also want to know the geographical location of the audience. Some products in warmer climates may not appeal to colder climate audiences.

3.  My favorite show on contemporary television is Grey&apos;s Anatomy.  Since most of these shows are older than I can remember, I am not to familiar with them.  However, I believe the Ed Sullivan show is a talk show; I think Dallas is a soap opera; the Beverly Hillbillies is family sitcom, and Cheers is a show that would be closest of the shows on the list to grey&apos;s anatomy.  Since its a cast of co-workers and their personal drama&apos;s.  

Q2:
Television has played a huge role in the election.  SNL has played an integral part especially with the Sarah Palin situation.  TV shows have done a good job at bringing forth the importance of voting, and having knowledge about politics and the election.  I think that candidates have appeared on late night comedy programs because of the audiences they are trying to reach.  Younger to middle aged voters.
This clip below is a little different than the candidates appearing on late night shows.  This a clip from Dave Letterman&apos;s late show where McCain cancelled his appearance, which cause a little bit of an uproar.

The basis for this news article is a phone interview with vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  Since there was no real cause for the article other than to get Palin&amp;rsquo;s feelings on a few issues, it is an attempt at some positive PR for in lieu of all of the slander that the media has produced in the previous months.   PR was originally developed to put people in a more positive light, so this is a good example of positive PR.  The message is not exactly clear but it is effective in its ability to generate sympathy for Palin and the negative criticism she must endure because of who she is and the position she is running for.  Some quote include &apos;Palin has been making more substantive speeches in recent days on energy, children with special needs and other issues&amp;rdquo; and &apos;Having absorbed hard shots during the campaign, Palin said she was taking the criticism in stride, although she feels there have been lies reported about her family and her record.&amp;rdquo; Showing that she continues to try hard; the overall point of the article is that she has motivations greater than just winning the campaign.  Overall the article is a good example of positive PR in a world where media pushes the negative because people are more interested in hearing about the bad than the good.  It has a clear and effective message that Sarah Palin is trying hard to win over the  American people, and develops sympathy for her by showing she has taken hard hits throughout the campaign but continues on.

Palin has had to take some hard shots, some she brought on herself.  This does show the human side of her and the fact that she can be competent and passionate about relative issues.  Overall, she has come a long way.  I think that if she jsut would stick to the things that she knows and study the areas that she need to learn she will do fine.

This video is a video that was originally put out by Hillary Clinton and was later used by John McCain. The video is of children sleeping in their home. There is a narrator that is describing a situation in which the phone at the white house is ringing. There is a world crisis happening, and the video asks who you would like to answer the phone, someone with experience handling the issues, or someone with none. The video makes a play on parents&amp;rsquo; emotions claiming that they would want someone answering the call at the White House who has experience in handling national security issues. Parents want their children to be safe, therefore they would not vote for Barrack Obama.

This is definitely negative publicity put out to discourage voters to vote for Barrack Obama. If a person feels that he does not have the experience to handle world issues, as the video suggests, they would not vote for him. This makes the video effective. Not only does the video say that you should not vote for someone who is inexperienced, it makes the parent feel as if it would be an irresponsible act to vote for someone who could have a negative effect on the safety of their children. The video is also effective because it creates emotion in the viewer, causing fear, making the person more likely to adhere to the videos message.

Overall, it is a strong message that is effective because it elicits an emotional response in the viewer.

Bush&amp;rsquo;s 2004 commercials. Whether &apos;soft&amp;rdquo; images of sleeping children or &apos;frightening&amp;rdquo; ones of snarling wolves, does it really matter what is shown if the underlying message is to create fear&amp;hellip;scare tactics are scare tactics.

I liked Obama&apos;s response; he said it is not about the amount of experience someone has when picking up the phone, but the kind of judgment you make when you answer? Basically, he countered by arguing that judgment always trumps experience. He even turned it around to his advantage by pointing out that when our country experienced a &apos;red-phone&amp;rdquo; moment on whether to invade Iraq, that Clinton and McCain gave the wrong answer.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='61256'/></branch></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='gObama'/><attribute name='message_id' value='62472'/><attribute name='message_title' value='gObama'/><attribute name='message_date' value='03-11-08 16:13:10'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225746790'/><attribute name='author' value='Kristine McCurry'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='

As soon as I read this assignment the first thing I thought about was Obama&amp;rsquo;s infomercial that he aired on several networks during prime time. Because this was the first time this had ever been done, and because of the intensity of this election, I think that there were more eyes on this than there would have been in any other election. This was obviously a publicity effort, everything that all politicians do is a publicity effort!! For Obama this was his chance to lay out his plan, uninterrupted, with all eyes on him. He was able to lay out his plan for the middle American, the ones that he needs their vote, and he was able to do so without having to answer to someone on the opposite end of the podium. He was able to go into the homes of the Americans who will be voting for him, and visit them personally by touching on things that are personal to those voting. By being able to explain his ways he&amp;rsquo;s going to fix the healthcare system, the slipping economy, the spending cuts, the federal budget, the foreign oil crisis, and of course the War in Iraq. He is able to talk to the small business owners, instead of Exxon Mobile, and the drug companies. Retirement was a big focus on Obama&amp;rsquo;s mind when making this infomercial, this is obviously because of the current failing businesses that are unable to give the pensions people have been paying into. And also, education and the fact that everyone needs a chance to be advanced, and the fact that each parent wants the same thing for their child. But makes sure that there needs to be involvement from the parents for the children to succeed. His infomercial was able to let Obama tell who he is, what he wants to do, and what he needs American&amp;rsquo;s to do for his plan to be successful.

1. I believe, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard and read, that Obama&amp;rsquo;s message was well received from those who watched. However, I am unconvinced that anyone who was dead set on McCain changed their mind from this infomercial. I believe it could have made more of a difference on the undecided, which was probably the point.
2. Yes, Obama&amp;rsquo;s message is clear and effective. Of course, this is coming from someone that is voting for him! So, I&amp;rsquo;m bias!

&apos;On Your Side&amp;rdquo;. This is an Ad that supports Obama. The ad positively promotes Obama by stating that Obama is on the peoples side, whilst McCain offers lower and middle class &apos;Joe the plumbers&apos; no tax relief. It states that McCain&apos;s plan is to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the corporate world. In addition, McCain&amp;rsquo;s plan to tax health benefits, for the first time in history, is also noted. To put Obama in the better light than his opponent, the ad ends on the note that Obama proposes no tax hikes on any families whose salary is under $250,000.
This message is clear and effective because the PR story is directed to the majority; middle- class Americans. In addition, all of the statements are backed up from sources by the press at the bottom of the screen, which makes each claim feel more legitimate to the viewer. I think even the fact that the portion of the ad that explains McCain&amp;rsquo;s plans attempt to show him as disconnected from &apos;the people&amp;rdquo;, as it simply shows him by himself on a black background, talking with a moving screen playing in the background of American citi. The people are shown without him. Yet, when Obama comes on the screen, it is always very animated around a crowd of praising Americans. This is to illustrate the title of the ad; &apos;On Your Side&amp;rdquo;.
After seeing quite a few ads of both candidates and some of the debates, I don&amp;rsquo;t entirely consider Obama&amp;rsquo;s ads as the classic publicity stunts of completely mud-slinging his opponent to try to gain support. Actually, in contrast, McCain does that to the fullest.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Obama Buys Air Time'/><attribute name='message_id' value='62968'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Obama Buys Air Time'/><attribute name='message_date' value='04-11-08 14:52:31'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225828351'/><attribute name='author' value='Heba Abouarabi'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='

The link above is of an article that talks about presidential nominee Barak Obama buying air time on three major TV networks.  This presidential election has been very interesting and it&amp;rsquo;s been an election that is drawing much enthusiasm from the media and the public alike.  Obama bought a half hour of uninterrupted broadcasted time on MSNBC, NBC, and CBS.  This event took place on October 29, 2008 which comes just one week before the general election for president of the United States.  
            According to the article 30min of air time is estimated at costing $500,000.  Obama&amp;rsquo;s PR plan has been criticized by many; however this effort is being called an attempt to talk directly to the American people.  Throughout his campaign Obama has prided himself on speaking directly to the people and getting in touch with the &apos;young&amp;rdquo; generation.  Of course senator Obama was heavily criticized my senator McCain for doing this, claiming he took the public&amp;rsquo;s financing to fund his effort.  
            Both candidates have relied heavily on public relations to set themselves apart and distinguish themselves in order to gain more votes.  Obama&amp;rsquo;s decision in buying air time is just another example in how PR is helping to spread the message of each candidate.

The publicity in this video is positive toward the Republican candidate for presidency we&apos;ve all come to know; John McCain.  I think the message is effective because it relates all of the &apos;Joe the Plumbers&apos; of the world to those in the video.  However on the other hand I also think it&apos;s kind of overkill.  The press made such a big deal about how many times John McCain referred to &apos;Joe the Plumber&apos; in his third debate against Barack Obama.  It was funny at first but then got ridiculous.  Most people probably think this video is funny because they may feel that they&apos;re a Joe too.

Michelle --

I want you to be there with me on Election Night when the results come in. 

we&amp;rsquo;re planning a big event that will include tens of thousands of supporters in Grant Park in downtown Chicago. 

We&apos;re saving some of the best seats in the house for 5 people who have given to the campaign before -- and who decide to make a donation one last time before Sunday at midnight. 

If you&apos;re selected, you can bring a guest, and we&apos;ll fly you in and put you up in a hotel for the night. You&apos;ll go backstage at the big event and -- no matter what happens -- you&apos;ll have a front row seat to history as we celebrate the supporters who got us over the finish line. 

Any donation counts -- whatever you can afford. Show your support at this crucial time with a donation of $25 or more, and you could join me on Election Night: 

https://donate.barackobama.com/frontrow 

This movement for change has been a testament to the power of ordinary Americans coming together to achieve extraordinary things. 

I look forward to having you there on Election Night. 

Thank you, 

Barack 

Is the publicity negative or positive?   The publicity is positive to me but to some others, especially the non supporters may find some negativity in the publicity. It&amp;rsquo;s positive to me because I find it to be quite impressive and welcoming because I have never known of a Presidential Candidate to offer a supporter to come and be with them on election night let alone have a website. 
This particular publicity is positive. However, it seems as though when I signed up to receive email messages from www.barackobama.com only, I started getting emails from many other supporters which have become a little annoying, causing me to have a negative attitude because they have been flooding my email causing my mind to go on over load.
Is the message clear and effective?
This message, along with many others, is quite clear; were being offered an opportunity of a lifetime for a monetary donation of our choosing. However, it clearly states, $25.00 or more gives you the opportunity to be with Senator Barack on election night to watch the results com in. This is very clear, and quite tempting.

One thing we learned in this chapter is that PR research targets specific audiences.  Most people know that Barack Obama is a Senator from Chicago. Barack mentioned Wall street and banks doing bad.  Mentions our troubled economy with 600k people losing their jobs since January.  He mentions healthcare is getting more expensive yet we are getting less for the money.  He mentions what needs to change.  Reform taxes for the middle class.  Protect investements and pensions he mentions.  He wants us to be freed from being dependant on Middle East oil companies.  I believe that the publicity is in a positive manner. Not only is showing Obama as concerned Senator but it shows him caring about the general public (middle class).  he leaves out how he will reform the taxes but he does make mention of them.  I believe the message was straight to the point.  It was a little &apos;muddy&apos; but overall it was a good message.  He did mention alot of what he was going to do for the country though and I would like to see all of that happen.  Was a good PR message though.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 9 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='61025'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 9 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='30-10-08 23:15:03'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225422903'/><attribute name='author' value='Carrie Dragicevic'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I like how you noted that he mentioned tax reform but doens&apos;t say how he&apos;ll do it.

This has been a very original and somewhat comical election. Many firsts have taken place with possibilities for many more, such as the first African American President of the United States or the first female Vice President, Sarah Palin, who I focused my discussion on. 

As a woman, it encourages me to see the success that women have had in this election. Maybe Hilary did not win the nomination, but she gave Obama a run for his money and McCain, in what seemed a last minute decision to sway some votes, chose the controversial and unfamiliar first woman governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. She always seemed to be portrayed as a well put together, distant and somewhat cold woman that commanded attention in a power suit. Many blamed her persona for her teenage daughter&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy, because they could not associate the politician with the mother. 

So when I was watching Saturday Night Live the other week, I was surprised by the skit featured in the link. I thought for sure it must have been Tina Fey impersonating Sarah Palin and was stunned to find out that it actually was Sarah Palin. I thought it was hysterical and an incredibly smart move on her part to appear on the show and basically spoof herself. I think it helps shed some of the &apos;ice woman&amp;rdquo; persona that she is associated with and exhibit her sense of humor, making her more approachable. It also presents an opportunity for the McCain / Palin campaign to connect with younger, more laidback constituents that are undecided or uninformed about where to put their vote. I think the message that Sarah Palin can also be fun and let loose was pretty clear and her appearance on SNL added a new tone to the publicity surrounding her.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Palin on SNL '/><attribute name='message_id' value='62049'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Palin on SNL '/><attribute name='message_date' value='02-11-08 17:50:11'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225666211'/><attribute name='author' value='Salam Makki'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I missed that episode of SNL but watching the clip I now really want to see it.

I definitely agree with you that is a PR strategy in that it&apos;s a way for candidates to connect with younger viewers since they make up the majority of the viewing population of SNL. Both Palin and McCain has recently been on the show and both have spoofed themselves and the publicity surrounded it was outstanding.

A lot of the young people I talk to are strong Obama supporters, so I can understand how Palin thinks that she is going to capture the votes of more young people by acting like they do, and I don&apos;t know how it will affect the votes on Tuesday, but overall I don&apos;t think it was a good move.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value='61301'/></branch></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Palin on SNL '/><attribute name='message_id' value='61941'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Palin on SNL '/><attribute name='message_date' value='02-11-08 14:48:17'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225655297'/><attribute name='author' value='Matthew Maes'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I think Sarah appears on Sat.

Also, they are slowly helping to shutdown the small business owners by providing many services and products all in one store.
The positive PR that was sent out will help put out the huge backlash they received and any small amount of money donated will help them out in a huge way and eliminate the bad taste in a lot of consumers mouths. WAL*MART should help some families out as a way of giving back whether its a tax deduction or not.

The PR video that I chose was the 30-minute infomercial that Barack Obama put on the air last Wednesday (10-29) and was telecasted on seven networks. There was a lot of talk about this infomercial because for one, it was one of the largest ad buys in election history and two, many questioned whether it would be overkill or too extravagaent since there was only 6 days up to election day.
 
Regardless, people watched it and the infomercial was the most-watched telecast in U.S. prime time on Wednesday.The infomercial was an attempt for Obama to spread his ideas one last time before people voted on the next president. It talked about his background (including his parents and grandparents) and what issues he would take if he gets into office. He had people talk about their concerns and tell their stories about the way they live with the current economy struggle.
 
Is the publicity negative or positive? 
The publicity that was given to the infomercial was neither positive nor negative. Like I stated before, people were concern whether or not the infomercial was going to hurt Obama in the long run (saying that it might be a little over the top and unnecessary since he was already winning in most polls) or if it would actually help his campaign with only days until election days.
 
After the infomercial, people thought the infomercial was done tastefully and in the fact that it was watched more than the World Series (according to the USNews.com) then people were definitely interested in what Obama had to say.

Is the message clear and effective?
The message is very clear. The infomercial clearly lays out the problems that American families are facing in this day of age and what Obama is willing to do for them if elected into office. It definitely shed light on major issues on every person&amp;rsquo;s mind and Obama wanted to reassure them that things will change under his presidency. The message was very clear and I think, from the reviews I read about it, was effective.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: wk. 9 assignment 1 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='62177'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: wk. 9 assignment 1 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='02-11-08 22:37:44'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225683464'/><attribute name='author' value='La Rhonda Lewis'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Holly,
The ad was clearly a restatement of Obama&apos;s strong points.  I think that it would have been more effective if he had addressed some of the areas that people are not secure with his stance.  I participated in a forum with 3 Obama supporters, 3 McCain supporters, and 3 Undecided voters.  We watched the broadcast together and discussed it.  The Obama supporters thought that it was effective, but he already have their votes.  I think that it should have reached out to the undecided a little more.

This advertisement of Barack Obama is of course a positive one. It focuses on portraying his public relations and interactions with everyday common citizens of the United States. It shows him as a caring person worthy of the job as president and responsible enough to uphold the duties that come along with that very important title because he has proven himself to be worthy. He has been a very effective and hardworking member of the United States Senate and has helped the poor and those who are not so well off and in need of health care get just that, a plan that worked for their individual circumstances. Barack Obama is shown to be an eloquent speaker, forward thinker, hard worker, and a man of high hopes ready to lead America to a bright future and a better tomorrow. I think he displays what a president should be like and embodies what a person of such high stature when president should entail.  I believe the message is very positive because they are correlating Obama and describing him with things that most people would consider to be good things and compliments. They are not demeaning, but rather boosting his character and his leadership skills. I think this advertisement is clear and concise and gets straight to the point of building him up and portraying his most admirable qualities and ones that are necessary for a President of the United States to embody, while doing it in a positive light where their prime goal is focusing on Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s assets rather than pointing out John McCain&amp;rsquo;s (his opponent) flaws and shortcomings as the McCain advertisements do and therefore are very negative and not so effective.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Obama for Change!'/><attribute name='message_id' value='60316'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Obama for Change!'/><attribute name='message_date' value='29-10-08 17:22:41'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225315361'/><attribute name='author' value='Lauren Madison'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPmYr52du6M
 
I found a video on YouTube trying to connect Senator Obama to terrorism, because they claim he is Muslim, and has terrorist ties.  I used this video because it is the upcoming election and there are so many attacks toward the candidates. I thought using this video could link this subject to other public relation ads. This video was designed to negatively affect the Obama campaign. The PR aspect of blogs, interviews, ads, video, or news articles are designed to shape the viewers in a way they can control, and change they way you feel. What I mean is these people have one job. Their job, as a PR agent is to engage the viewer the best way possible, to maybe they can get them to feel the way they want them to feel. They use videos to effectively do this. Videos are great because they can leave a lasting memory in a persons head, so long as they keep the content interesting.
In this video they used sound effects from bombs to get the viewers attention. The music they used was designed to scare, and haunt the viewer. The screams of men and children to make the viewer fee sympathy, and the pictures they made of this man were all designed to get the viewer to feel the way they want them to feel. They want the viewer to feel as though Obama is related to terrorism and that he is connected to Sadaam Hussein and possible terrorist attacks. 
This publicity effort is designed to turn voters away from Senator Obama because they know he is so close to taking over the United States. This is a very crucial election so they are trying to come out with as many videos, and ads as they can to target this man, and make him look bad. This publicity is definitely negative. This video is making a man look as though he is not. The problem with this ad is they use false information and pictures. They have pictures of Obama they have created, and put scarves on his head as though he is Muslim and a terrorist. 
The only part of this message that is clear is they crazy. Whoever created this video s obviously trying to put out negative messages! The video message is clear and thorough that Obama has terrorist ties, and that he is going to take over the U.S and turn it inside out. They made a clear video, but it is not effective because you can tell the pictures are not real, and that Obama is not saying the words they are trying to say are coming out of his mouth. They made a clear point of what they want people to believe but you can tell that these images and video clips they are shooting across the screen is fake.

The publicity effort being made by Barack Obama in this ad was to make himself look good by talking about topics that hit close to home for everyone. In the ad Obama states that by choosing him we will end the war, create more jobs and save our environment. These three topics are the world&apos;s biggest concerns right now. By stating that he will end the war he will immediately grab the attention of families who have lost a loved one due to the war or of families who have a loved one over in Iraq right now. He also grabs the attention of people who are afraid of losing their jobs or have already done so by saying that we will have more jobs if we choose him. And the last topic will gain the attention of environmentalists, which many people are becoming today with the new &apos;Go Green&amp;rdquo; campaigns. 

His message is definitely a positive one. His whole campaign is about making the world a better place for everyone. I think his message is very clear. He gets straight to the point of what he wants to change if elected. He basically states that if he is chosen then the world would be great. I also think his message is very effective. As I stated before he discusses the three main topics on everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind and says he will make them better so how can that not be effective? He also shows all of these people supporting him in the video which makes the viewer more likely to believe in him.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 09 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='62040'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 09 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='02-11-08 17:37:01'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225665421'/><attribute name='author' value='Salam Makki'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Just watching the ad is refreshing.

Find an example of a PR story, video or mailer from any political candidate, either local or national. Discuss this publicity effort in 250 words or more.

The example I found is a story about a handful of reporters that were kicked off of Obama&apos;s campaign plane. The reason he kicked them off is supposedly reported that they had previously funded Senator McCain&apos;s campaign. The three reported Press&apos; that were kicked off were the Washington Times (who have covered Obama&apos;s journey to the White House from day 1), New York Post, and the Dallas Morning News. Obama&apos;s Campaign claims they kicked the reporters off due to the lack of space, however the Press&apos; claim otherwise.

Is the publicity negative or positive? 

I believe the publicity is negative. I believe this because now all three of these papers are not going to provide good coverage for the Obama campaign in their areas. They will, in my opinion, choose not to report things that usually they would report which would inform readers on what is going on positively with Obama&apos;s Campaign. Fox News enterprets this as a troubling effort for if Obama does become our President. They talk about Obama being subjective and possibly only allowing the top Press Coverage in on any issues in the future.

Is the message clear and effective?

The message is quite clear; effective, not so much. This message conveyed is that Obama is playing the &apos;sides&apos; game. In my opinion he is proving that as a leader he is only going to benefit the Democratic voters, where he should be doing what is best for the nation. I think Obama may have changed momentum in this election as it nears the end. Before this week I believed Obama had a sizeable lead over McCain, and now that little issues like this keep arising his campaign&apos;s momentum is possibly changing.

Is the publicity negative or positive?  
This PR is negative for it attempts to compare Democratic Presidential Nominee Barack Obama with that of Former Detroit Major Kwame Kilpatrick who was force to resign due to felony charges of perjury; Domestic Terrorist Bill Ayers who is said to have been involved with riots and terrorist attacks; and Anti-American Rev Jeremiah Wright who delivered a sermon using derogatory terms against American people. This video attempts to convey the negative attacks that Barack Obama&apos;s association will leads to an unchanged America. Although it has been documented that his affiliations with the above mentioned were not and are in no relation to his efforts to seek the Presidency. 

Is the message clear and effective? The message is not effective. This is another form or propaganda against the Democratic Party. This video was not endorsed by the Republican Party but another non partisan group. Their message is clear cut and to the point but those who researched each candidate knows that the describe affiliations are false and have been documented by journalists as well as from the spoken words from the Presidential Candidate.

This is a very good example of negative PR.
Unfortuately, people tend to remember the bad things they hear about someone before remembering all the good things they&apos;ve heard.  I wish the Political parties and Independents would stick to the topics that are important to the American people, and the people abroad and not attack each other with a bunch of nonsense.  I went to vote yesterday and while I was reading the names of the Judges I had to chose from I came across the name of Judge who&apos;s family use to work with me, over 10 years ago.  However, as soon as I seen the name, I thought about the negativity that was going around the office about that particular family.  I actually 2nd guessed my decision to vote for that Judge because of that.  
It&apos;s true, negativity stays in our minds, and for a longtime more so then something positive.  This is why this type of PR is effective eventhough it&apos;s a bunch of Propaganda.

This video is from around the time of the Democratic primaries. Although the video is from the past it serves the purpose of showing viewers that Barack Obama is not as distant from the public as many other political figures.  Many people complain that the biggest problem with politicians is they have lost touch with everyday people and can not connect with them.  Many politicians try to show the public this is not true about them by doing various things. Barack went about trying to show people that he can relate by making an appearance on Saturday Night Live.  During he skit, he wasn&apos;t pushing his political agenda or trying to come off as a politician, but rather just another celebrity type appearing opening the show.  

The publicity in this situation was very positive for Barack.  He was just trying to get his face out to the public without pushing any political issues.  During his skit he didn&apos;t mess up any of his lines or anything that made him look foolish or silly.  John McCain performed a similar act on the Late Show with David Letterman where he showed up, however this was after he had already cancelled his original engagement. In Senator McCain&apos;s situation, I think it was a little negative because the people at the Late Show took offense to his original cancellation and used him as the butt of more jokes. 

I think the message is clear that Barack is trying to show that he is a &apos;regular guy&apos; and not some political figure that has lost touch with average Americans.  Personally I think the message was very effective.  I feel like Barack is much in touch with myself as well as the average Americans views and concerns. Part is this may be due to the fact Barack is much closer in age to myself and average Americans but the fact that he could open SNL without without messing up him lines shows he has some connection with people.

The publicity of the  Obama&apos;s informerical was a very expensive, yet  positive, because it was efffective. He was able to get  his stand on many of the important issues. I think that the infomercial set him apart from McCain.  Obama has been running his campaign completely different then most people. He seems like he does not want to just reform the nation, but sincerely wants to change the nation for the better. He wants to end the war, while there  is a strong possibility of  McCain of wanting to continue the war for absolutely no reason.  I hope the country can choice the right candidate based on their true potential, and look passed all the nonsense to run this nation as president. I don&apos;t think that it will happen, but the publicity for rest of the election has to bee good publicity, which I feel like it wont.  I still think we haven&apos;t seen the real candidates for who they are with the exception of the  few instances.  If I had to voted based on the three debates  I honestly don&apos;t know who I would vote for, because all three debates were just them bashing each other with out any truthful information really. 

The election in general I think has been a very interesting one, because both candidates just say what the people want to hear over and over and over, and we should expect at least some truthfulness.  Hopefully on Novemeber 4, the American people will pick the right candidate. I think that even though Obama is in the lead, its only by a narrow margin, so  its pretty much anyones game.

If McCain wins it will be the first time a woman will hold office as Vice President and if Barack Obama wins it will be the first time in which an African American will be holding office. So all in all I am excited to be present at such an invigorating time that will be making history. A common argument however, is on race and gender which seems to be the eminent highlighting issues being the fundamentals of this particular election. Firstly, with Obama being African American and then with Palin being a female. Many believe the people will vote for Obama only because of his race and Palin because of her gender. On the Howard Stern show he took a poll to figure out if race was an issue with Obama. He took the liberty of talking to people in Harlem asking them why they would vote for Obama just to see if it was a race issue. He then mixed up Obamas issues and coincided it with Obama&apos;s, for example he asked this one lady if she would vote for Obama because Palin (being a female) was going to be v.p and if she accepted this and to my surprise she said yes! When I heard this clip on the air I was appalled and it left me speechless!!

 
This publicity, I would assume is both positive and negative. It is positive because it is a clear realization on a lot of issues. It is negative, however for the same reason! The message being conveyed here is indeed clear and effective in depicting certain people&apos;s perspectives. I am not generalizing here..I myself am guilty for the same reasons..initially as soon as I heard Hilary Clinton was running for president my initial reaction, being a female myself, was yes! I am definitely going to vote for her, despite her issues. The same could have been for Palin, Until I began to pass my own judgments as their issues ultimately came to light.

In this ad we see presidential candidate Barack Obama talking about his background, believes and his family.  It portrays a humble, smart Barack Obama that is what we are looking for in a president after the last eight years dot he Bush administration.  This is the type of ad that gets to the general public that is part of the lower and working class that is one that is starting to become one.  Barack talks about him being raised by his single mother, and grand parents, the values that were instituted in him that make him the man that is today.  How he had to work and take student loans to achieve his educational goals.  He touches on how he turned down jobs in Wall Street to go back to Chicago to work with the needy; he passed laws to help to help newly displaced workers that lost their jobs in the steel industry.  He created programs to move people from welfare and got them jobs.  This is a very positive campaign that in this economic downturn that we are dealing with many people can relate to. I reviewed many ads for this assignment, but this was the one that I liked the most because it didn&amp;rsquo;t bad mouth the other candidates, I just stated facts.  I believe Obama is the right candidate for the presidency of the United States. We will know the effectiveness of this ad next week if he wins the election.

The intensity of media activity is certainly prevalent in this election. It has been exciting but I am even more excited that it will be over this Tuesday. It is amazing to me that some people rely on T.V. ads for their information and are swayed to a particular candidate. I am tired of all the negative ads by both parties. However, I am looking forward to Nov, 4th.

               I choose the article on Time&amp;rsquo;s website that covers the recent news on Congressman Tim Mahoney. Tim Mahoney has recently received a lot of coverage on a national basis, including NBC&amp;rsquo;s Nightly News.  The coverage of Mahoney has definitely been negative. Representative Mahoney of Florida is only a week away from the election. He is under investigation for allegedly paying $ 121,000 to keep a former staffer quiet about an affair they had in 2006. He also promised the staffer a job at a media firm to help keep her quiet and to avoid a sexual-harassment lawsuit. 
                The FBI is also currently investigating if any campaign dollars or taxpayer funds were used in his settlement with the former staffer. A second woman who is a high-ranking official reportedly also had an affair with Mahoney while he was in office. ABC News reported allegations that Mahoney went out of his way to help the woman secure a $3.2 million hurricane-cleanup reimbursement from FEMA.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Election Day/ Public Relations '/><attribute name='message_id' value='60751'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Election Day/ Public Relations '/><attribute name='message_date' value='30-10-08 13:25:15'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225387515'/><attribute name='author' value='Sarah Wegener'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Leave it to the media to only focus on the negative things!

In Dearborn, one of the judges for 19th district court is up for re-election.  I have received a few political mailers from his campaign and he has even come knocking on my door about a two months ago to encourage support.  The political mailer that I have chosen though is from his opponent  Candyce Ewing Abbatt.  

I have received many mailers from her campaign and on one day received three at the same time. This particular mailer is trying to convey an extremely negative image of her opponent, Judge Somers.  

To start, there are three key phrases on the front of the mailer.  The first states &apos;Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick cost Detroit taxpayers 8.5 million dollars&apos;. Next one states &apos;Fired 48th District court clerk awarded $3 million&apos; and the last states &apos;How much will incumbent Judge Somers cost Dearborn taxpayers&apos;  

Obviously there is nothing positive in this message, not even about herself.  It is just a direct attack on a judge.   Actually when I first read the mailer I thought the 3 mill lawsuit was a result of Judge Somers and after talking to a few friends was told that it was false.  When I looked back at the mailer I realized that it was another community not Dearborn.  If I made an error in reading the document then so can many others.  I guess in that sense its kind of effective.  Not right...but effective.  Judge Somers has actually been trying to deal with the situation with what the book called &apos;damage control&apos; or &apos;crises management&apos;.  He sent out flyers defending himself and went door-to-door talking to local residents and address any issues they had with him.  

Overall the message may be effective in confusing voters and smearing the opponents name but it is not clear by any means.  Statements are made and you try to understand how they relate to Judge Somers, it doesn&apos;t even tell you what he did wrong.  You just know that there is some kind of lawsuit out there against him.  His rebuttal though has been far more effective in getting the truth out.

This is a clip from The Ellen Degeneres Show that aired last Wednesday, 10/22/08, featuring a surprise appearance by Obama via satellite from Miami, Florida.  Ellen calls a number that is supposedly for Obama&amp;rsquo;s campaign and shockingly gets Obama himself. Then the television screens click on to show him outside in front of a screaming crowd of supporters. His shirt sleeves are rolled up and he&amp;rsquo;s not wearing a suit jacket. He&amp;rsquo;s dressy, yet casual &amp;ndash; one of the people.
The whole objective of this pseudo-event is clearly to bring Obama down to a relatable level. There is NO talk of politics. The topics range from Obama&amp;rsquo;s dancing (and he does a little dance to go with it) to his daughters&amp;rsquo; Halloween costumes, to George Clooney.  He jokes about campaigns and politics (it is vital to our nation that Clooney appear on Ellen&amp;rsquo;s show; he considered wearing a pirate costume to a debate), taking away some of the gravity of the political situation that can become unbearable to listen to after hearing about it nonstop for months.  The message is clear: Barack Obama is a normal, fun-loving, husband and father who likes to joke around and isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to look goofy dancing in public.  It is an incredibly positive PR move.
This interview is directed to specific audiences: mainly women and young people. It is primarily women that watch the show, and it is young people who will be the most drawn to his fun-loving personality instead of political spin (and also the most likely to access the interview on the Internet, as I just did). It&amp;rsquo;s also most likely aimed at undecided voters (as is everything the candidates do this close to the election) who may be swayed by his show of youthful energy. People already dedicated to McCain don&amp;rsquo;t care what he does, they won&amp;rsquo;t vote for him. People already dedicated to Obama don&amp;rsquo;t need the show, they&amp;rsquo;ll vote for him anyway.
This is probably a fairly effective interview for the Obama campaign. It currently has over 90,000 views on YouTube and a 5 star rating. The comments are mixed, but most of them are arguing about his policies or are racist. The ones actually related to the video clip are very positive. And, personally, regardless of my politics, I have to admit, after watching this video, he seems like a pretty cool guy that I&amp;rsquo;d want to hang out with. And that, I think, is exactly what the goal of the interview was.

I know I should be responding to the subject but I thought your comment was so funny. After watching the video you thought about him, and said he may be pretty cool, and cool enough to hang out with. That is what this is all about. Could you ever see yourself hanging with Bush?NEVER! Its amazing that in 2008 our country could change so much. Over the last 30 years African Americans have dealt with nothing but racism...So now it is time for change. Isnt it amazing for people to be able to come together for one common cause. We should work for change instead of working so hard agaisnt one another to seperate and segregate ourselves because in the long run we all have to live with eachother and deal with eachother. No one is better than the next.  These ads are very effective because they make us think about these things and make better decisions.

In this chapter we learned that, &apos;PR uses similar strategies to project a client&amp;rsquo;s image to the appropriate audience. Also like advertising, PR research targets specific audiences.&amp;rdquo; (Media and culture) In this PR story Barack Obama is doing just that. We all know Barack Obama is a Senator from Chicago. What we most people did not know is that his mother died at the age of 53 from cancer. In this PR story Obama is trying to show that his family is not different than most American families across the nation. Yes, he is on the verge of becoming America&amp;rsquo;s next president and he is using his own life experiences as a tool to run and advertise his health care plan.  I believe that the publicity is in a positive manner. Not only is showing Obama as concerned Senator but it shows him interacting with everyday people. He is showing that he really does care about everyday health care problems. What is neat about this clip is it is also showing Obama above the pack in Washington  D.C. it is showing that Obama is already a step ahead of lobbyist whom have been at the same point for 20 years trying to reform healthcare. I believe the message was clear and straight to the point. The only down side about the clip is that it only shows a link to view the health care plan. I believe if it had a few main bullet points it could have even been stronger.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: week 9 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='60431'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: week 9 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='29-10-08 20:44:50'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225327490'/><attribute name='author' value='Anisa Deen'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value=' Hey Emmad..Lauren basically said it all here..i was writing my own notes on the side until I saw her reply and cant help but second it.

I have selected to post two videos because I think that people should be aware of what each candidate is doing.  The first video is an ad for Barack Obama.  Basically it is an ad defending Obama from the lies that McCain is telling about Obama.  This ad shows proof that McCain is running ads that are lying about Obama.  In several instances John McCain is distorting what Obama is saying and is attacking him in a negative way.  This is obviously negative publicity for John McCain.  The message here is very clear and it is, John McCain is a liar.
The second video that I posted is a clip of Barack Obama on the Today Show.  This clip shows that Obama is distorting what John McCain is saying.  Obama is saying that McCain is in support of 100 years of war in Iraq when in fact that is not what McCain is saying.  When Obama was asked if he wanted to admit what he said was a lie he said &apos;no, go to the you tube videos and look up the quotes&apos;.  The video then cuts to other you tube videos proving what Obama said is a lie.  This is obviously negative publicity for Obama.  The message is very clear here as well, Obama is a liar.
The reason that I selected these two videos is because it seems that each candidate is more worried about what the other is saying and trying to distort it instead of being focused on their own beliefs and plans.  The candidates should be more concerned about getting their messages across than trying to attack what the other one is saying because it is making them both look foolish.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: PR '/><attribute name='message_id' value='61370'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: PR '/><attribute name='message_date' value='31-10-08 16:08:46'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225483726'/><attribute name='author' value='Emmad Awaad'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value='i like how picked to clips to show us both side of the story.

It is also refers to the entire range of efforts by an individual, agency, or any organization attempting to reach or persuade audiences.
The informative circular I received in the mail today promoting Sean Kavanagh does just that. In this case, Sean Kavanagh who is running for the City of Livonia&amp;rsquo;s 16th District Judge is trying to persuade residences to vote for him. His circular includes who endorses him and who he is supported by as well as his qualifications for this position. Also Mr. Kavanagh includes a letter to the citizens expressing his accomplishments how he is going to work hard to achieve his goals as well as the citizens of Livonia if he is elected.
 
In my opinion this circular is positive. It does not have anything negative to say about his opponents. It simply states the facts, i.e. why he is qualified to be our judge. He also doesn&amp;rsquo;t promote or bring up any political issues. He actually states in his circular that he is supported by both Democrat &amp; Republican leaders in this non-partisan race.
 
The feel the message he is trying to get across is also clear. He is trying to show everyone how he is just average like everyone else. In the letter to the citizens included in the circular he states how he is one of 11 children and comes from the average American family. He also states he has learned early on in life that nothing comes without hard work and dedication and that is how he will continue to be.
 
Since this circular is put out by Sean Kavanagh and his campaign committee rather then by news reporters this is without a doubt an example of a PR story.

This PR piece was carried by FOX News Network. This PR was meant to give credence to the accusations against President-elect Obama of terrorist affiliations. The publicity was obviously negative for President-elect Obama. The message was clear but also very ineffective. It exposed a lot of pettiness in the McCain campaign. You cannot make assumptions about a person simply because of an acquaintance they may have. It is not even clear the extent of Mr. Ayers and President-elect Obama&apos;s relationship.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Election'/><attribute name='message_id' value='72886'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Election'/><attribute name='message_date' value='04-12-08 22:32:17'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1228447937'/><attribute name='author' value='Christina Ponder'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24550'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='300706'/><attribute name='message_body' value=''/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch></branch></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 8 - Propaganda and the Media'/><attribute name='forum_title' value='Week 8 - Propaganda and the Media'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24465'/><attribute name='forum_date' value='20-10-08 09:56:17'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1224510977'/><attribute name='forum_short' value='Propaganda in the media today.'/><attribute name='author' value='efomin'/><attribute name='type' value='forum'/><attribute name='forum_extended' value='Propaganda in the media today.&lt;br/&gt;'/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 8 - Discussion Option 1 - Find an Example of Propaganda in the Media'/><attribute name='topic_title' value='Week 8 - Discussion Option 1 - Find an Example of Propaganda in the Media'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296966'/><attribute name='topic_date' value='20-10-08 10:13:38'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1224512018'/><attribute name='author' value='efomin'/><attribute name='topic_short' value='Find an Example of Propaganda in the Media'/><attribute name='topic_extended' value='&lt;font face=&quot;verdana, sans-serif&quot;  size=&quot;2&quot; &gt;By Friday, October 24, Find an example of propaganda in the media.

Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?
I think propaganda is effective.  It scares people into believing things that usually aren&apos;t (completely) true.  No matter how ridiculous or unbelievably biased some things seem to be, people will inevitably believe and agree with them.  Basically I think it works to scare people into believing whatever its artist or creator is advocating for.

Short Answer Questions

1. What is propaganda analysis? 
Propaganda analysis is necessary to determine when, where, and how propaganda is used.  An example of when propaganda has been analyzed was after World War I; media researchers were interested in how it was used to progress the war effort.

2. How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting? 
Agenda setting is the idea that the media has a substantial influence on audiences by their choice of what stories to air and for how long, and also what stories to leave out.  The stories that are chosen by stations go along with their viewers&amp;rsquo; beliefs, which is somewhat unlike propaganda.  More people see the pictures and advertisements of propaganda because it&amp;rsquo;s not only on certain stations.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='75822'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='15-12-08 20:16:56'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1229390216'/><attribute name='author' value='Christina Ponder'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24465'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296966'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I like this one!

Propaganda is the most effective means used by all levels of society to spread any form of information.  The most effective means of propaganda by the media is used in a time of war. This link above is a picture from WW2 era. The American media printed propaganda photos such as these portraying German troops as savage almost devil- like mindless animals to instill fear in the American people. The producers of this particular photo are urging the public to push for total production while illustrating that liberty is at risk. Propaganda was also used after 9/11 to push for a war in Iraq. We are all witness to the aftermath of that costly mistake. Propaganda is a very effective tool to twist the hearts and minds of the public to gain support.

Propaganda analysis was used to help the war effort in WWI. Researchers analyzed the use of propaganda to control the hearts and minds of the mass population by spreading fabricated rumors, images, stories in a form of social communication as told by Lasswell. Agenda setting is how the media spins to alter public opinion by down playing or omitting certain facts from a story. On the flip side they can drill the public with a certain story over and over again until it becomes main stream.

This is the example of propoganda I found on the web. This poster is aman holding his hand over another man s face, and n bold letters theyhave &apos;know your place, shut your face.&apos; They are using the  american fag on the clothing to show you, this message s totally about the American governemtn wanting us to go along with what they want us to do. They knw the war snt right, and unjust, however they want to to beleive everything they do is right and we should know our place as citizens, and go along with what they want us to go along with. this poster is satirizing the current &apos;war on terrorism&apos; and all the rhetoric. 

When looking at several propoganda posters, I found that alot of companies and agencies use propoganda to persuade different audiences. Propoganda is effective most of the time because it can persuade a group of people to feel a certain way. Through posters and advertisements propoganda is very effective by the humor, satires, colors, and several emotional effects to get the viewer tuned into their message. Propoganda is effective because it has been used so much, and according to studies people are more able to relate to the subjects, or the propoganda more, when it is used. I think propoganda is most effective when the aim it at people who needs it most. When it comes to the war and propoganda, they try to use the most effective methods of propoganda to influence the people war is okay. I say that ffor how the governement used propoganda to get into Iraq. This to me is a form of terrorism. We are killing people, and tourturing people over there and interrupting their lives, at war. There have been so many reports of innocent people getting killed and injured, as a result of US armie, over there invading their country. They use propoganda to influence weak minded people. So this mean it will be easier for them to believe they way they want them to. They want us to go along with whatever the governement says, and they want us to believe what they say is what is rght, and we all should follow suit .They use propganda to cover up the thruth, to draw people in. 

Propoganda analysis is the general concern about propaganda and the way it is used to change the mind settng of the people. It&apos;s concern is over the decrease public ability to develop their own thought and ideas, rather than relying on false, and misleading propaganda. Propaganda analysis is suppose to help people how to think on their own. Propaganda analysis shows who controls and influence people through propaganda, through dfferent chanels of communiication. The difference between propaganda analysis and agenda-setting is agenda-setting is designed to use the mass media as a means to transfer only the important media. The agenda-setting theory focuses on the rate at which the media covers a story and how people take this imformation into acount. The agenda-setting theoy shows how the mass media positions their agendas for public opinion by emphasizing specific topics they want to public to know and feel about particular subjects.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Propoganda!!!

1.   Propaganda is effective is the timing is right, like this picture of Uncle SAM came out right before WWI. This is the most recognize recruiting poster in the world.
2.   Propaganda analysis is the process identifying how propaganda influences people. With access to the Internet readily available propaganda can reach many people in seconds; is hidden in chain emails, popup windows, games, and many websites.
3.   Agenda setting is the use of mass media used to change public opinions, or behaviors.

Here is a classic example of propaganda in the media, from World War II. 

If you buy war bonds, will you be helping the US army? Yes. If you don&apos;t, will the Nazis get your children. No! 

I think propaganda can be very effective. Like the war bond ad, they appeal to your emotions and instincts (Nazis, BAD! Children, good! Buy war bonds!!), more than your rationality. They&apos;re also catchy, so they stick with you. You may look at this ad and think, &apos;Yeah, whatever.&apos; But when the time comes to buy your war bonds, the message will still be with you, encouraging you to buy them and save the children from the Nazis.

Propaganda doesn&apos;t have to be an advertisement. Reporters and journalists help shape our perspectives on things. Simply put, we often believe what we read in the paper, especially if it&apos;s repeated numerous times, regardless if it&apos;s true or not.

Propaganda analysis was one of the first topics of mass media research in the 20th century, and involves examining the propaganda in the media and discern how much of an effect it has on the thoughts and opinions of the public.  It began after the massive amounts of propaganda bombarding citizens during WWI, during which time propaganda was considered a positive, patriotic force.  In 1927, Harold Lasswell did a study on it, and called propaganda &apos;the control of public opinion&apos;, which clearly has a negative connotation.  Today, some social scientists use propaganda analysis to try to keep this from happening, teaching people how to think instead of what to think.

Propaganda is a clear attempt to advertise a point of view and influence people to agree by stretching the truth and lying by omission. Agenda setting involves the mass media&apos;s impact on how the public views news by how they deliver it. A story that is incredibly newsworthy (such as Bush admitting that Hussein was not involved in the 9/11 attacks) may be pushed back a few pages or given minimal, if any, attention.  If the news doesn&apos;t shout about it, very few people take notice.  Like propaganda, this omission or downplaying of information can greatly alter public opinion.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='57331'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='23-10-08 10:09:16'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1224770956'/><attribute name='author' value='Echo Kiser'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24465'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296966'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree that both propoganda and agenda setting stretch the truth in order to get their point acrossed.

Is propaganda effective? 
I feel that propaganda is effective in persuading uninformed individuals. This theory is labeled the hypodermic-needle theory or the magic bullet theory. Propagandists basically tell people what to think or believe. They build the strongest possible case for their views and many times they discourage discussion. I do not think that all propaganda is negative, but I feel that an individual must educate themselves on both sides of the issue at hand.
What is propaganda analysis?
Propaganda analysis is the process of analyzing and exposing the &apos;tricks&amp;rdquo; and tools that propagandists use to persuade people. Our text book provides the example of the study performed by Harold Lasswell after WWI. Harold Lasswell focused his studies on many media representations.

How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
Propaganda analysis is the study of the different ways that propaganda is used to persuade or manipulate a &apos;weak&amp;rdquo; audience. The analysis dissects the &apos;tools&amp;rdquo; and symbols used in propaganda.  Agenda-setting is different because the discussion is determined by the number of times an issue is addressed by the media. The more often the media covered certain topics, the more interested the general public became in those issues.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Propaganda and the Media '/><attribute name='message_id' value='57329'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Propaganda and the Media '/><attribute name='message_date' value='23-10-08 10:04:54'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1224770694'/><attribute name='author' value='Echo Kiser'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24465'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296966'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree that people should educate themselves on both sides of issues before choosing a side.

TheTruth is an anti-smoking propaganda campaign.  It largely targets the youth and uses disturbing photos, captions, and facts in an attempt to prevent people from starting to or continuing to smoke.  

Propaganda can be effective. It largely depends on the audience it is targeting.  Some are obviosuly more easily swayed than others.  For example, many people find it hard to believe the statistics presented in TheTruth ads.  

Propaganda uses selective facts to sway and target its audience.  Adenga setting is something done by the media industry as a whole.  Its done by deciding which stories are worth presenting, and really pushing them in quantity.  Propaganda analysis is very similar because it is a means of studying the ways in which mass media effects people&apos;s opinions. It started after WWI in an attempt to see how certain ads pursuaded the war effort.  Propaganda and agenda setting are very similar, but differ when it comes to scale and variety. I think agenda setting deals on a much larger scale and propaganda has a negative and misleading connotation.

Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?

I believe that propaganda is extremely effective and a very useful tool that can be used.  If you noticed, the monster is stepping on America while torturing a poor defenseless woman.

1. What is propaganda analysis?

After WWI, media researchers became interested in the ways in which propaganda had been used to advance the American war effort.  Researchers labeled propaganda as &apos;partisan appeal based on half truths and devious manipulation of communication channels&apos;.  Harold Lasswell&apos;s 1927 study of Propaganda Technique in the World War focused on media representstions, defining propaganda as &apos;the control of opinion by significant symbols, by stories, rumors, reports, pictures and other forms of social communictaion.

2. How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?

I think that propaganda is effective. Propaganda tends to use catchy images, words, slogans, etc that stick in your memory easily. Propaganda is designed to get the public to view things a certain way or to do certain things based on the content.
 
The example image that I chose is from World War II. It portrays &apos;Rosie the Riveter&amp;rdquo; who is a tough, hard working American woman who is ready and willing to step up and go to work in order to support wartime efforts while the men were away. Posters like these were designed to get women out of the kitchen and into the factories.

Short Answer Questions

1. What is propaganda analysis? 
 
According to our text propaganda analysis is the research of the propaganda in order to determine how audiences could be persuaded through stirring media messages about patriotism and duty. It was one of the earliest forms of US mass communication research that was prominent during the twentieth century&amp;rsquo;s two world wars. 

2. How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
 
Agenda-setting is actually a media research argument that sates when the mass media pays attention to a particular event or issue they determine the major topics of discussion for individuals and society. Propaganda analysis is strictly research. There is no argumentative factor involved.

I think that in this case the Rosie the Riveter was a call to action.  This made women think that they could do a job that they had never considered or desired. Although most women are tough, they were taught to let that part of them be dormant or expressed in the care giving of their families.  This agenda just brought encouraged women to do what was really natural to them, roll up their sleeves and pitch in.  I don&apos;t think that the researchers ever considered that once these women were sent into the workforce that they would never return to the sweet quiet housewife in heels and pearls waiting for her man to come home.  Maybe their plan backfired on them.

I think propoganda is effective because it acts like a commercial and we all know commercials work. In this propoganda it bascially states that if you join the navy you will become a real man and have muscles like the ones pictured. Just as commercials today advertise products by saying that if we buy whatever product they are selling we will become sexy or beautiful. 

1.  Propoganda analysis is when researchers look at how effective or how much propoganda has influenced people to do what the propoganda is trying to sell. For example, how much of an influence did the propoganda above influence men to join the navy? 

2. Propoganda analysis differs from agenda setting because propoganda analysis is done by research to see whether or not propoganda is effective whereas agenda setting is not so much research but a theory that media can influence and manipulate people&apos;s minds.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 08 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='57642'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 08 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='23-10-08 23:39:34'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1224819574'/><attribute name='author' value='Carrie Dragicevic'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24465'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296966'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree that your example of propaganda would be (and probably was) very effective in recruiting young men into the navy.

I would think this ad would attract boys with a poor body image, looking for some way to feel better about themselves. 

On the other hand, army recruitment is pretty much a &apos;business&apos; in the sense that they need to &apos;sell&apos; a product of questionable desirability. Most young men and women don&apos;t really want to go to war, but a little suggestive selling will convince many to enlist. I guess they should use whatever works for them. I&apos;d just like to think our government would be above the level of Axe commercials, using pretty people to influence others.

Used correctly I feel like propoganda can be very effective.  During wars and political races, both very important events, proganda is used a lot.  Effort would not be put into political propoganda unless there is a clear result from the propoganda.  

What is propaganda analysis?
Propoganda analysis looks the message that the general public is going to receive to from the piece of propoganda.  This is very important becuase if the wrong message in conveyed then the whole point of the propoganda is lost.  In a very bad situation, the message that is conveyed could be the opposite of what the original intention was suppose to be.  

How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
Agenda setting is the media creating awareness of a certain issue/side by making that information availible to te public more than another issue. Becuase we rely on media to inform about events around the world, they can influence what we think by what is and is not shown to us.

This is a piece of WW2 propoganda to get people to buy war bonds.

Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?
I think propaganda can be effective for the people who are trying to get their message across.  This is because propaganda can be very persuasive, sometimes using untruthful but demanding advertisements to influence its audience.  This can be bad for the general public because some are so strong to a na&amp;iuml;ve person may be persuaded to buy something or do something they regret later.  Propaganda can be manipulative.  For example the propaganda pictured above leads its audient to believe that if you get a war job you&apos;re husband or family memeber will come home safely from the war.  In truth, getting a war job can be helpful to the war, but will obviously not guarentee a loved one coming home safely.

Short Answer Questions

1. What is propaganda analysis? 
Propaganda analysis is the process of researching how propaganda as had an effect on the public.  There is an actual Institute for Propaganda Analysis, and they research how the public has been influenced by propaganda, and what propaganda techniques were used. 

2. How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
Agenda-setting is a theory that mass media has a large influence on the public, by which they choose is important to report. Propaganda analysis is not a theory but it is research on how it affects its audience.

Propaganda can be very effective in many instances.  As far as American history is concerned, &apos;positive propaganda got its start in the world wars.  Propaganda was used to rely many messages to the American public at that time one example of this propaganda was used greatly to influence people to be very careful when speaking to anyone about troops or their whereabouts.  I think propaganda is a very effective way to get the message across in a very simple way that everyone can understand.  The link below is for a website that I found that has many WWII posters and an explanation talking about each one. The one that caught my eye was the one that I mentioned above about a woman accidentally giving away secrets about the troops it had this caption.  &apos;Wanted for Murder: Her Careless talks cost lives&apos;.  http://www.oddee.com/item_66536.aspx

              According to our textbook, propaganda analysis is figuring out how to control or manipulate opinion using various tactics.  These tactics can include stories, rumors, reports or pictures, whereas Agenda setting is a media research argument that says when the mass media pay attention to particular events or issues.  Agenda setting is when the major topics of discussion for individuals or society are set for them or predetermined.

Very interesting article about a Michael Moore movie and the propaganda tactics used in it.
As far as I am concerned, anything Michael Moore has even produced is propaganda.  It is heavily one sided and does not tell the whole story.  It leaves out necessary parts to show the true context of what he is presenting.  He may not be creating facts, but he leaves out so much of the true story that what he does present can be interpreted in the wrong way.  He designs he films with the intent of his material being interpreted in the wrong context because of his lack of the full story.  When all of these stories taken in the wrong context are put together, they may appear to create a strong point that many people buy into.  He has created strong propaganda that has influenced many people.  
Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?
Propaganda as a whole cannot be analyzed by whether it is effective or not.  It should be analyzed by how effect it is and how people react to it.  There are many types of propaganda created for many different reasons.  They are directed at certain people with intended purposes.  Therefore, propaganda should be measured by how effective it is, not by whether it is effective or not.  The example I presented about Michael Moore is very effective propaganda since it is widely distributed and believed by many.  There is propaganda that is not as effective, but it does not change the fact it is propaganda and at least one person bought into it.  For propaganda to be effective, the people exposed to it have to accept it.  Therefore, the effectiveness of propaganda is 100% based upon the people who believe it.

According to Chapter 15, Propaganda analysis was a major early feature of mass-media research after World War I, where researchers used it as a way to advance the war effort. Merrian Webster&amp;rsquo;s second definition for Propaganda is the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person. The Free Press states that top officials recruited dozens of &apos;military analysts&apos; to spread favorable views of the war via every major news channel -- without revealing they were working from Pentagon scripts and often lobbying for major military contractors looking to cash in on the war. I consider it a level of peer pressure, which can prove to be very effective to very patriotic or even closed-minded individuals.
 
According to Wikipedia, Agenda setting gives mass-news media a large influence on audiences by their choice of what stories to consider newsworthy and how much prominence and space to give them. Two basic assumptions underlie most research on agenda-setting: (1) The press and the media do not reflect reality, they filter and shape it; (2) media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues. I believe that it is a slightly lesser form of propaganda, because it predicts that if people are exposed to the same media, they will place importance on the same issues. Where propaganda tries to force ones to conform to a train of thought, Agenda setting tries to place the same priorities in peoples mind and mold them into a form of view. I found an image that shows that FOX does so:

Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?
Propaganda is effective because since we are surrounded by media, there is no getting around the fact that people can be easily influenced and manipulated into thinking something that a certain type of media wants them to believe. Propoganda can be effective in making people see a particular side or issue. Especially when it comes to elections and wars (the poster above is from the WWII era) propaganda is everywhere, urging people to see this way or that way. Whether people see it, hear it or read it, propaganda can be a very useful tool to get people to believe a particular media source.

What is propaganda analysis? 
Propaganda analysis is a way of identifying how propaganda influences people. The Institute for Propaganda Analysis (IPA) was created in 1937 and its main purpose is to educate the American public about the widespread nature of political propaganda. The IPA is composed of social scientists and journalists and it also is known because it identifies several propaganda techniques that are used to influenced people. (http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/intro.ipa.html)

How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
Propaganda analysis is different from agenda setting because in agenda setting, the media controls what propaganda is actually going to be used for the public to see. The media is able to decide what issues are going to be presented and what path they are going to take to influence what the public will actually watch and see on a the media circuit.

Propaganda is a way to create a way to inform and shape the opinions and viewpoints of the public. For example, war time propaganda.  It is use to show the public just what a good reason the war is and that they should support it in any way possible, and if they don&apos;t  then they are considered disloyal. Also, propaganda create loyal public to whatever needs their support. 

Propaganda analysis is when the true effects of propaganda are seen. The analysis looks at the concerns of how propaganda manipulates the public into thinking in a certain way. It further looks that the way propaganda is interpreted in the mind of public, and to make sure that its not taken out of context. The difference between Propaganda and  agenda setting is different, in the sense that propaganda just tries to inform and sway opinions and viewpoints in a certain directions. Agenda setting is when a action is taken place. Something is done to enforce the opinion or viewpoint.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Prop in the media'/><attribute name='message_id' value='62434'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Prop in the media'/><attribute name='message_date' value='03-11-08 15:23:44'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225743824'/><attribute name='author' value='Kristine McCurry'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24465'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296966'/><attribute name='message_body' value='
Would propaganda be used for as long as it has been if it weren&amp;rsquo;t effective? I believe that propaganda, indeed is effective. And, although propaganda is usually viewed in a negative light, I have decided to look into propaganda being used more usefully. Thetruth.com is a on running ad campaign to end smoking, and it does so by attacking the cigarette companies. I believe that propaganda can be effective to a certain extent, where it only is able to sway a small number of those who are subject to it. As for thetruth.com, although I do not think that it has been the sole reason that people have quit smoking, I do think that it can add support to someone who may have been thinking about it.

1. Propaganda Analysis is something that came about after World War I, because some researchers became interested in what the effects of the propaganda that had become apparent during the war, had on the advancements and continuations on the war. There are several things that are looked for when analyzing propaganda, some aspects include things such as; name calling (popular in political campaigns), glittering generality, transfer, testimonial, plain folks, card stacking, and band wagon.
2. Agenda setting is something that the media outlet is setting out to make the topic of conversation. For example, in a political campaign there are things that the camp wants to talk about, and things they&amp;rsquo;d rather avoid. While agenda setting, they make a plan of attack and figure out how they are going to come out smelling like a rose in each of the situations. This is where they are able to shape their platform to make it fit perfectly into the agenda. Propaganda analysis, is what breaks this down and figures out what the agenda is, and hopefully can dissects the campaigns intentions.

Propaganda in very effective in the media.  It helps to persuade people one way or the other.  The media or producers of the propaganda with do whatever it takes to help persuade people though lies, manipulation, and false information.  Especially in politics people will take information out of context to alter a situation into their favor.  

1. Propaganda analysis is sifting through the propaganda presented to find the truth.  Propaganda analysis is a useful tool to have and to use.  Checking sources and facts is a good way to help with the analysis of propaganda. 
2.  Propaganda analysis differs from agenda setting because of the information content.  Agenda setting wants to put forth informationor a message to a mass population.  Propaganda usually contains negative false information used to persuade viewers.

Propaganda is very effective because it works on an emotional
level. It is usually designed to stimulate or arouse the emotions of the
reader. Emotion is very powerful an often supersedes the rational thoughts of a
person. There are even books written on emotional intelligence. Such as with
this particular piece of propaganda showing an African-American and Caucasian
man working side by side with an American flag in the backdrop. This stirs
feelings of patriotism and brotherhood. The military often employs the
propaganda and it has proven to be very effective hence the United States has a
very effective volunteer based military (obviously except for during wartime
when the draft is enacted). My favorite piece of propaganda is Rosie the
Riveter.Itﾒs a poster illustration of a
very ﾑtoughﾒ woman with her hair tied up in a scarf something that a woman
during that era would have never been caught outside of her home in. sheﾒs
wearing a very no-nonsense facial expression with her arm raised displaying her
ﾑgunsﾒ (upper arm muscles). This poster was meant to incite independence among
women who were needed to fill the voids made in the workforce made by male
absence due to WWII. Up until that point women were not allowed to work. A
working woman was not socially acceptable and many women simply didnﾒt have the
courage to enter the workforce despite many of them needing the income while
their husbands were off fighting the war.

A propaganda analysis is the study of what make the general public &amp;lsquo;tick&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s what a good campaign manager/politician does in a sense. It&amp;rsquo;s the dissecting of the American public&amp;rsquo;s psyche and manipulating their thoughts by evoking emotions with whatever the research says would achieve the results desired.
Agenda setting is the media taking advantage of their access to the vunerable viewer. The media often does this by means of fear mongering. The media force feeds their viewing/listening/reading audience with images that provoke fear, mistrust, and panic. Whereas, the use of propaganda incites positive emotions such as patriotism, loyalty, and unity.

These television ratings, which compartmentalize the different age appropriate ratings for various shows, tell me that the ability of media research is quite minuscule and it does not have the capacity to change policies within the media. The media will air any shows they deem possible thus leaving it up to the media research to monitor, review and rate them as aids for families and youngsters in today&amp;rsquo;s society. Potential problems may or may not arise accompanying or as a result of this rating system. However they are the dimensions of the media and still allow the for the guidelines to rank particular shows. The rating system I do believe is quite an effective tool but is often overridden by viewers who tend to neglect or ignore them. These only set measures for various types of media, however they do not set ground rules or restrictions, which are measure that are important and should be taken into consideration more frequently. These are merely descriptions and not guidelines, which are important to potential underage audiences, thus further expressing the lack of stringency in today&amp;rsquo;s society. The rating system is effective on the other hand because it sends out a warning to the viewers as to what should be expected from this particular program, thus filtering out any unnecessary or unacceptable content. 
 
The television rating system developed as a response to a perturbed society, mainly parents, who felt saddened by the explicit material being portrayed on their television sets. The Payne fund studies were a series of experiments to test children&amp;rsquo;s reactions and the effect of film content on them. They contributed to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code in that their research pointed on the effects that certain programs have on kids&apos; behavior, moods etc. thus suggesting the importance of ratings for programs in order to send out warnings to viewers, in particular concerned parents.

2.   I personally think that the current TV rating system is not good, it should be identical to what Hollywood uses so people don&amp;rsquo;t get confuse.  I remember growing up and we had 3 ratings; G, PG, and R for movies.  I feel I turned out OK watching 
3.    The current television rating was mandated by congress in 1997. Studies shows that kids that watch violence on tv will most likely become violent as they grow older.
4.    The Payne Fund was a private foundation that conducted a series of research studies performed to examine movies and their effects on children. There were a total of 13 studies financially supported by the Funds. Each study fell into one of three main categories of research: film content, audience composition, and effects on children. The researchers found that there were impacts on children moviegoers ranging from learning and attitude change to emotion stimulation and behavior influence.

The television ratings show that media research has the ability to change the policies within the media. The media research is what determines what gets on television and determines what rating category the show fits into. 

What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?
There might be problems that might accompany the rating system because it may be a bit unclear to some people. Some of the letters are the same with different abbreviations adding to them. Some might find this unclear, and may allow their children to watch. 
1.      How did the television rating system develop? 
The current television rating was mandated by congress in 1997. The rating system was created as a response to the growing concern over the increasing violence and sex being shown on television.

2. What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code? 
The Payne Fund Studies were studies done in 1929-1930, by researchers trying to figure out what kind of roles movies play on the society, especially children.  They did research on three areas, film content, audience composition, and effects on children. The Payne Fund Studies made a correlation between children watching violent movies and how their behaviors changed after watching them. Then the Production Code was establishment by the film industry, and in the 1960&amp;rsquo;s it was replaced by the current ratings system.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='59077'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='27-10-08 16:11:05'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225138265'/><attribute name='author' value='Matthew Maes'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value='I agree regarding some of the letters are the same with different abbreviations.  you make a great point.

These ratings tell me that the broadcasting companies are in full control of the programming and how a show is rated. If a Producer of a show wanted their show to be seen by all ages; the broadcasting company can come and give that Producer&amp;rsquo;s show a rating that only a certain age group depending on how the broadcasting company views the show. However, the Producer has put a lot of hard work and time into their production; they want it to be viewed by everyone. The Broadcasting Company could cause the Producer&amp;rsquo;s show to either fail or be a complete success. 
The Producer could either have a million viewers watching his show or a few hundred thousand viewers watching. It&amp;rsquo;s all up to the Broadcasting Company.
 
What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? 
I believe one potential problem could be the fact that once an adult see the rating Violence (V), Sex (S), coarse Language (L), and sexual Dialogue (D),A Parent could see that and make the decision no to allow their child to watch the program. However, just because the rating system list Violence (V), Sex (S), coarse Language (L), sexual Dialogue (D), it could be a show that is being used to educate our children about these categories.
 
Do you think the current ratings system is effective?
The current ratings system is effective because of how much more detail it is oppose to how the ratings system of the early days use to be. The earlier days system didn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate enough to let a parent know if their children should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be watching a certain movie. For example, the movie Grease came out in 1978. It was rated G which most parents would think this is an okay movie and their child could go and see it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think a movie that is showing high school students drinking, smoking, driving too fast and having sex is a movie many parents wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want their children to see, and yet, it was rated G. This is why I feel the current rating system is very effective.
Just read below and you will see how detailed and simple it is to understand.
 
 UNDERSTANDING THE TV RATINGS

    
        
            
            All Children

Alot of media research has been conducted to come up with this rating system.  You can almost always portray the data to be in your favor and look however you want.  I know sometimes the rating system can be ineffective because it does not always catch things that are viewed as &apos;bad&apos; for a younger child.

***What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?***

I think it might be too strict or too many &apos;rating classes&apos; for today&apos;s society.  I recall we just had P, PG, and R.  If it wasn&apos;t R, I was allowed to watch it.  I seemed to do okay.  There is alot of violence that was on TV and I think the new rating system is to help weed out some of this to keep the younger children from viewing this.  I think the current rating system might be too complex.  I&apos;m sure there is overlap and there is a struggle to determine which category to put a program in.

***How did the television rating system develop?***

Research shows the FCC started up the new rating system.  This was developed in the mid 90s because there was being too much violence on the programs available to children.

***What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code?***

The Payne Fund Studies was a research study done through a series of research studies that were targeting what kind of role movies play on children.  There was a total of 13 studies supported by the Payne Fund.  Each of the studies fell into one of three categories: film content, audience composition and effects on children.  The researchers discovered that there was impacts on children which ranged from learning problems to attitude changes.    Emotional simulation and behavioral influence was also affected.  I think censorship came about because of these specific studies.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 8'/><attribute name='message_id' value='57996'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 8'/><attribute name='message_date' value='24-10-08 22:36:19'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1224902179'/><attribute name='author' value='Patrick McCollum'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value='What do these television ratings tell you about the ability of media research to change policies within the media?

The rating system shows that reserach conducted about the viewing of various television shows can be harmful to certain age groups. As a result of these studies, the television industry felt it neccessary to inform the public about what type of show they are about to view and allow them to make decisions before the show about whether or not it is appropriate.

What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?

The greatest problem that I see with the current system is the ability to properly place shows into the correct rating category.  Now that the information is availible to people, we need to make sure the infomration is accurate and consistent.  I think the rating system is efective.  Combined with the V-chip, it allows parents to make sure they are not watching bad shows even when the parents are not around.

How did the television rating system develop?

Rating systems came about becuase the media industry was pushing the envelope as to what was appropriate.  Also, the FCC and congress had made the suggestion that a type of regualtion was neccessary.

What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code?

The Payne Fund studies looked at the effect of the movie industry on children.  Movies were becoming more and more diverse and with improving technology more common to the general public.  The studies did show a connection between children viewing certain movies and acting out in school. As a result the movie industry enacted a guidline system that would rate all movies so viewers knew what type of content to expect.

And the fact that the television rating system is also pretty recent does not seem to be a coincidence.  Obviously media research has had a huge impact on television ratings due to the fact that they are widely accepted by the public.  I don&apos;t see how they really had any choice but to come up with a rating system.  Growing up I don&apos;t recall ever seeing ratings for TV shows. It was pretty much left up to my parents to make sure I wasn&apos;t watching anything inappropriate.  The caption in the book states that the rating system was &apos;self-imposed&apos; to keep the government away but the truth is that it was forced by an outside source (media resource) just not the government.

I do not think the rating system is really that effective.  I mean I think parents who are concerned about what their children watch already have a grasp on what needs to be done.  They know what channels or movies are appropriate.  They do not really need a rating system to tell them a show is inappropriate.  I think children who aren&apos;t supervised as often will continue to watch what they want no matter what the rating is.  If a parent is to busy to see what their child is exposing him/herself to then they will be to busy to even notice the rating.  Now..I am not a parent yet and I see myself in the future being a working parent so I could very well be wrong.  I just think that if my parents were able to do it without a rating system then so could everyone else.  I wasn&apos;t allowed to watch anything on tv after 8 oclock:(

The television rating system developed as a result of a media research method which included social psychology studies.  The fact that studies began proving that watching movies and tv often can directly result in violent behavior.  The book mentions that parents are quick to blame others for their childs behavior and these studies let them do just that.  The TV industry had to develop this system in order to keep the government from interfering and hold parents responsible.

Lastly,  the Payne studies were a set of social studies that emerged as a result of national concern about movies and how they effect children.  The studies contained 13 research projects and one was able to read a childs reaction to a given movie.  By proving that a child had a emotional response to certain movie scenes the Payne Studies were able to contribute to the establishment of the film industrys production code and movie content was &apos;tamed&apos; during this time period.  The Payne Studies also in a sense allowed for the development of the rating system.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Media Research '/><attribute name='message_id' value='58871'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Media Research '/><attribute name='message_date' value='27-10-08 08:52:35'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225111955'/><attribute name='author' value='Roberto Morales'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value=' I agree parents need to be more involve and make sure they spend more time with their children.

Certain group&amp;rsquo;s opinions or beliefs can influence policies or at least draw attention to the changing trends in the media, especially when it affects America&amp;rsquo;s youth. This can be good and/or bad depending on the lengths the groups will go to in order to implement change. It can be difficult to find an acceptable balance. If no one was concerned about the sexually graphic content it might explode and end up with the overexposed sexuality of some international television.

The article above details how ineffective the rating system is depending on what you consider appropriate programs for children and teens. The ratings do not apply to news or sports programs and unedited movies on premium cable channels, which also contain violence that may be inappropriate for young children. It reiterates (at least in my mind) that we NEED MORE PARENTAL GUIDANCE, and we need to reexamine the &apos;extreme reality&amp;rdquo; level at the heart of the &apos;trendiest&amp;rdquo; shows. At 8:00 PM on a Weekday, kids are watching, but all the shows are geared to adults&amp;hellip;very few of those adults make their children leave the room or check to see what they are actually watching in their room&amp;hellip;to distracted by the literal and perceived &apos;reality&amp;rdquo; (extremely detailed sex, gore and violence) that has consumed entertainment television&amp;hellip;leave something up to the imagination!

I don&amp;rsquo;t let my 11-year old daughter watch many of the shows I watch, as most of them have PG-13 or R ratings. I typically DVR them and watch them when she&amp;rsquo;s asleep or not home. Since she was a little girl (3 or 4), I told her some things are an &apos;Adult&amp;rdquo; program or activity and I have been lucky enough that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t question just accepts no. But, I have very little control over what other parents allow their children to watch and I know she is still exposed to it.

There is the V-chip that allows parents to block certain television programming by the rating established by the broadcasting industry. However, most of the parents I know do not bother to set it up or their kids just get around it. 

1. How did the television rating system develop? 

The television industry designed the ratings system &apos;TV Parental Guidelines&amp;rdquo; to give parents more information about the content and age-appropriateness of the programs shown on television. It was modeled after the movie ratings to be easily recognized and simple to use. The ratings apply to most television programs, including those directed specifically to young children. A monitoring board exists to ensure that ratings guidelines are applied accurately and consistently across the television programming spectrum. 

The Parents Television Council started out as the television &apos;watchdog&amp;rdquo; department of the Media Research Center that was responsible for monitoring the level of content featured in television programming, especially during prime-time. With the support of influence political voices like Vice Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman and entertainment industry leaders like Charlton Heston, they are trying to hold someone accountable for the overwhelming amount of sex, language and violence that are now part of &apos;family prime-time viewing&amp;rdquo;, especially on premium channels like &apos;Skin-emax&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;the name says it all. 

2. What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code? 

In the late 1920&amp;rsquo;s to early 1930&amp;rsquo;s, The Payne Fund, a private foundation, funded a total of 13 research studies that examined films for content, audience composition and the effect on children. The results showed an impact on children ranging from learning and attitude change to emotion stimulation and behavior influence. They basically indicated that the level of crime and sex in movies influenced youngsters to become juvenile delinquents and criminals. These innovative studies laid the groundwork for the continued research and interest in how children are impacted by movies, television and video games. The Production Code was establishment by the film industry in order to manage the perceived offensive ideas and imagery that was called into question by research like that being done in the Payne Fund studies. In the 1960&amp;rsquo;s it was replaced by the current ratings system.

The television ratings shows that media research has a lot of ability to change policies in the media. However, media will not change their policies because they know what sells, even if it is not the best thing to sell, they want a profit and thats what they will get. 

I think there are a few potential problems that could be caused by the new television ratings. I believe that the ratings are far too specific. I never saw anything wrong with the three basic ratings we had before. I think it creates parents to become too protective of their children because they may fear a younger child watching something that is supposedly suitable for 7yrs old and up and their child is only 5 or 6. 

1. The television rating system developed by the Federal Commuications Commissions. It was developed because of the increase in complaints about sexual content and violent graphics in progams today. 

2. The Payne Fund Studies were studies done by researchers on what kind of role movies play on society. They researched three areas which are: film content, audience composition and effects on children. The Payne Fund Studies contributed to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code by making a correlation between children watching violent movies and how their behaviors changed after watching them.

I believe there is some truth to this thought, however in my opinion these current ratings are a little restrictive, but then again you need to look at what people are influenced to do by the smallest of influences. People are influenced to do anything they see on tv. I appreciate the fact that we have alot of restrictions on what we do and what we do not censor. I do feel there needs to be some disgression put onto the parents, however some parents are not &apos;parent-like&apos; and can become just plain lazy when it comes to parenting.

    What do these television ratings tell you about the ability of media research to change policies within the media?

 
Just having the ratings for programs speaks for itself as to the ability of media research to change policies.  Not only are there ratings on television shows, but there are for cd&amp;rsquo;s and video games.  Research conducted allows production enterprises to understand the effects of the media they put out for their audience and allows viewers/consumers to know what they are purchasing.  I am from a time when the &apos;Explicit Lyrics&amp;rdquo; on albums was just put into effect.  Prior to that, kids could convince their parents to buy an album for them without knowing the content.  
 

    What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?

Potential problems may be that parents will base their decision solely on what the rating is for the program, not on what program is right for their child.  If parents see a &apos;TV 14&amp;rdquo; they may allow their 14-year-old to watch the program regardless of that child&amp;rsquo;s maturity level.  
 
I don&amp;rsquo;t have children and personally never pay attention to the ratings on the television shows that I watch.  It seems to me that the ratings cover most things that are seen on television today and without this being a worry or concern of mine, seems adequate.
 
1.      How did the television rating system develop? 
 
The rating system was a response to growing concern over increasing violence and sex being shown on television.  It is similar to the production code in that it was a way for the television industry to police itself without involvement from government/FCC.  The FCC and Congress did propose the rating system and it is currently in effect. 
 
2. What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code? 
 
The Payne Fund studies were conducted during 1929 and 1930 to study the effects of movies on children.  During that time, movies were a new and unknown media source and many parents feared the effects of this new technology on children.  The studies confirmed the parent&amp;rsquo;s fears and found that they acted out in school more often and displayed poor behavior than non movie going children. These studies along with government intervention and concern over what was being shown lead to the creation of the production code. This was a way for the production companies to police themselves so that their films would still be produced without interference from the government.

These television ratings are different then what they were when I was growing up. There were no TV ratings at that time! Only movie ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R, and X (of course) I think that much research and many parents petitioning brought about these rating additions. The research done must have been substantial enough to prove a need for ratings on TV.

What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?

Everyones perception of what is appropriate and what would not be appropriate at certain ages are different. What someone may deem appropriate for a 7 or 14 year old, may not necessarily be something I would want my child watching. Without reading the descriptions, it could easily be taken at face value. Within the descriptions they are careful to use words like &apos;most, some, and may&apos; but without reading the description you may assume &apos;all.&apos; Also, the ratings are a bit confusing. If I saw a TVY7 or a THY7FV - I wouldn&apos;t know hte difference.

People first began to wonder how specific war campaigns effected the thoughts of Americans, so research began. This spurred the thought that some media was inapporpriatly received by youth, so further psychological studies were done to see if there was any truth behind that thought, most significatly the Payne Fund Studies.

2. What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code?

The Payne Fund Studies was research conducted on different age groups as they viewed media. Electrodes were hooked up to the subjects and it was noted through the measurement of heat, at skin level, the different non-verbal reactions people had to the pictures they were seeing. The youngest groups (age 7) had the greatest sub-consciensce reaction to violence, whereas; the teenagers had a similar reaction to love and sex. This was the begining of many other studies conducted to base the current rating system off of.

These ratings tell me that the ability of media research is actually efficient in changing policies within the media. These &apos;ratings&apos; help determine what &apos;groups&apos; are fit to watch certain programming. I think ratings help determine what is suitable for certain people to watch.

What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?

I think the current problems would be that some of these ratings might look appealing to a younger audience and they would want to watch certain programs just for the thrill as opposed to watching programs that might suit their maturity level. I do believe this current rating system [so far] is effective. This informs parents about what is about to come on TV and if they should change it or leave it. These ratings also help to lock out certain channels who may show this kind of content more often than other networks.

How did the television rating system develop? 
This system was proposed by Congress, the FCC and the Television industry in 1996. It was proposed in response to the increases in material such as sexual content or explicit violence/language to prevent them from being open for younger audiences to watch. This proposed idea was set in stone in 1997 by congress.

What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code?
The Payne Fund Studies are a series of research studies that were performed to examine movies and the effects they had on children. The studies had shown that there were impacts on children that changed their learning as well as provided attitude changes. The studies also showed emotion stimulation and influence on behavior. This point helped establish the film industry&apos;s production code.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Option 1 - BCorder '/><attribute name='message_id' value='58476'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Option 1 - BCorder '/><attribute name='message_date' value='26-10-08 16:37:33'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225053453'/><attribute name='author' value='Salam Makki'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value='It didn&apos;t even occur to me that a child (especially a child who understands the rating system) would want to watch a particular show due to the rating.

The ratings for television shows are evident that media research influences media outlets to be responsible for informing their viewers. This rating system is more of a protective mechanism for the media than for the parents. By having this rating system in place, the parents cannot claim ignorance with regards to what their children are exposed to. 

What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?
 This rating system is not effective because it is informational only and has no preventative or protective measures to ensure that the appropriate viewing audience is the actual viewing audience. The potential problem is that the rating system is at not all inclusive and may expose a younger audience to adult content other than language and sex.

1. How did the television rating system develop? 
Television rating systems were developed by implementing the findings of social psychology studies. These studies were sometimes biased and politically or economically motivated.

You make a really good point.  I&apos;ve never thought of the Media using the rating system to protect themselves and not so much as to protect the public.  I can understand them wanting to protect themselves from the public especially after all the complaints and Law suits that came from the public whenever there was a school shooting, or a gang related violance and so forth after opening weekend for a newly released movie that may have had a shooting in it.  

However, the rating system is only for information, it can&apos;t protect or prevent the public from going to see a movie they really shouldn&apos;t be seeing.  I think that should be left up to the movie theater, the Theater should ask for ID to make sure the correct age group is going to see the movie with the rating that meets their age requirements.

Problems and inadequacies are bound to happen form this rating system much like most everything else. Among such inadequacies lies a very important one that puts a big hole in the effectiveness of this rating system .This problem is the fact that while generally the majority of the population agree that this is a pretty accurate rating system there are still many others who maybe were not enough to get majority rule, but who nonetheless may be a significant amount that did not agree with this general concept of what is age appropriate and what is not according to the established ratings system. In turn, instead of being more effective the ratings system may just cause media corporations to suffer because they are failing to please everyone.

1. The television ratings show me that we can count on someone to help parents censor what their children watch. Because of tricky shows, like the Simpons, or King of the Hill for example could easily go past on a parents &amp;lsquo;ok&amp;rsquo; list simply because they are cartoons. Knowing that there will be a rating attached to their shows, and that if they want to get the largest audience of children to watch, writers for children&amp;rsquo;s shows may be more careful about what they are putting in the shows for the kids to watch.
2. I believe that there could be some potential problems and inadequacies that might accompany this rating system. Because the parents may not agree with the standards set forth by the rating system. So what one person may think is appropriate for their seven year old, another parent may think is inappropriate for theirs. Children grow at different ages, and there is no way to classify them all into being able to take in the same stimulates, and have the same reaction. I am very unfamiliar with the current rating system, however, my sister, who has a 5 year old generally follows the guide. Although sometimes she&amp;rsquo;ll let my niece watch a movie that she has seen and is comfortable with. Generally, she only uses the rating system for shows or movies which she is unfamiliar with. It also allows her to leave easy directions for baby-sitters when she isn&amp;rsquo;t there to monitor what my niece may be watching.
3. The rating system came about in the Telecommunications Act, where Congress called upon the video programming industry to establish a voluntary system to provide parents with information concerning &amp;lsquo;programming that contains sexual, violent, or other indecent materials about which parents should be informed&amp;rsquo; that is shown on television. And in February of 2006 all segments of the video programming industry pledged to create television programming guidelines.

4. The Payne Fund Studies were conducted to see the result of violent films on violence and acting out in children. The found a connection and went on add additional support to the fact that movies are more easily accessed with growing technology, that there needs to be a way to limit the children who are watching shows which can influence them.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Propaganda Analysis'/><attribute name='message_id' value='60071'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Propaganda Analysis'/><attribute name='message_date' value='29-10-08 10:06:45'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225289205'/><attribute name='author' value='Bethany Beckham'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value='

Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?
Yes propaganda is effective because mass media has a great influence on society. Take a look at the 2008 Elections and how SNL portrays the characteristics of the Republican nominee&apos;s. They make the VP selection seem less qualified and in turn the Republican Presidential Candidate unsuccessful to obtain the presidency. Also take into consideration the advertisement used against each party members to attempt to persuade voters, the AP has taken an analysis on how many negative ad&apos;s has been displayed by each Presidential Nominee. It has been said that the Republican Nominee has had more negative ads attacking the Democratic Nominee. The 3 Presidential Debates&apos; that have aired live on National Television are also effective to its viewers.
1. What is propaganda analysis?
Researchers after the war labeled propaganda as &apos;partisan appeal based on half-truths and devious manipulation of communication channels.&amp;rdquo; Harold Lasswell defined it as &apos;the control of opinion by significant symbols, . . . by stories, rumors, reports, pictures and other forms of social communication.&amp;rdquo;  The study of information, ideas, rumors deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, or group, movement, institution, etc.
2. How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
Agenda &amp;ndash; Setting: the idea that when the mass media pay attention to particular events or issues, they determine&amp;mdash;that is, set the agenda for&amp;mdash;the major topics of discussion for individuals and society.
 Propaganda Analysis is studying the information already available that have some form of direct influence over its viewers.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 8'/><attribute name='message_id' value='60601'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 8'/><attribute name='message_date' value='30-10-08 02:03:37'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225346617'/><attribute name='author' value='Vanisha Patel'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value=' Television ratings say several different things about the media&apos;s policy changes, and I think society as a whole controls the ratings.

The  inadequacies of the ratings as to do with how far society is willing to accept certain things in movies in the different ratings. I think we have done a decent job with the ratings, but it soon will be that ratings will not mean anything with the content of the movies. 

Television ratings developed because of the increase in the violence and sex that was being mimic from what was being shown on t.v.. So the expressed concern from the public  lead to the networks placing a rating system, which I think was a great way to somewhat control what kids see watch on t.v.  The Payne Funds Studies was a research study that was observing the effects of the kids behavior overall. The more violent and sex they watched the more they were inclined to act it out in  their own lives, which ultimately is what led to the increase in crime and so forth.

What do these television ratings tell you about the ability of media research to change policies within the media?

What potential problems or inadequacies might accompany this rating system? Do you think the current ratings system is effective?
 
When I was thinking about the ratings being accurate and effective, I thought about the ratings if they were applied to shows that aired, say, 30-40 years ago. Most of what is labeled today as TV-PG or TV-14 would have probably been aired as TV-MA back then. I believe it is more based on the broadcaster&amp;rsquo;s moral judgment of the television show and the idea of profit. What should also be considered is the individual&amp;rsquo;s maturity level, rather than age as there are many at the age of 14 who do not act as such. The same applies to younger ratings. I believe the fantasy violence does indeed have an effect on children, yet it is allow based on the ratings, to children 7 and older. My brother was about 7 when he thought he was the hulk and grabbed me (The older one- by 2 years) and slammed me down. So it is more important for parents to take the time to view, guide, and explain shows to children, rather than completely rely on a rating by someone who may have different morals.
Parents need not to rely on the standards set by &apos;who knows&apos;, but rather, be involved in knowing what their children are watching. This is a time where everything makes an impression on a childs view of things, and it is crucial that parents do not allow the television to raise their children.
 
Short Answer Questions

1. How did the television rating system develop?
 
The television rating system, or TV Parental Guidelines system was developed by  Congress, the television industry and the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC). The guidelines began being applied January 1, 1997. The guidelines were developed due to many public concerns of increasingly explicit sexual content, graphic violence and strong profanity in television programs with no ratings.

2. What are the Payne Fund Studies and how did they contribute to the establishment of the film industry&apos;s production code?
 
The Payne Fund studies, performed during 1929 and the 1930&amp;rsquo;s were developed by the Motion Picture Research Council, which was working on the development of a national policy concerning motion pictures, especially concerning children. There were thirteen studies conducted that addressed the influence of movies on children. The studies found that movies have a large impact on the attitudes, emotions, health, and conduct of young children and how they view the world around them. The findings eventually led to the development of a Movie Ratings System.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/></branch><branch><attribute name='name' value='Week 8'/><attribute name='message_id' value='62959'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Week 8'/><attribute name='message_date' value='04-11-08 14:32:58'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225827178'/><attribute name='author' value='Nickolas Maslak'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value='http://www.workingpsychology.com/download_folder/Propaganda_And_Fahrenheit.pdf
Very interesting article about a Michael Moore movie and the propaganda tactics used in it.
 
As far as I am concerned, anything Michael Moore has even produced is propaganda. It is heavily one sided and does not tell the whole story. It leaves out necessary parts to show the true context of what he is presenting. He may not be creating facts, but he leaves out so much of the true story that what he does present can be interpreted in the wrong way. He designs he films with the intent of his material being interpreted in the wrong context because of his lack of the full story. When all of these stories taken in the wrong context are put together, they may appear to create a strong point that many people buy into. He has created strong propaganda that has influenced many people. 
 
Is propaganda effective? Why or why not?
 
Propaganda as a whole cannot be analyzed by whether it is effective or not. It should be analyzed by how effect it is and how people react to it. There are many types of propaganda created for many different reasons. They are directed at certain people with intended purposes. Therefore, propaganda should be measured by how effective it is, not by whether it is effective or not. The example I presented about Michael Moore is very effective propaganda since it is widely distributed and believed by many. There is propaganda that is not as effective, but it does not change the fact it is propaganda and at least one person bought into it. For propaganda to be effective, the people exposed to it have to accept it. Therefore, the effectiveness of propaganda is 100% based upon the people who believe it.
 
Short Answer Questions
1.   What is propaganda analysis?
Propaganda analysis is the study of how effective propaganda is and the techniques used in propaganda.
2. How does propaganda analysis differ from agenda-setting?
Agenda setting is the media deciding what stories are news worthy. It is not designed material with the intent of heavily influencing the audience&amp;rsquo;s opinion like propaganda.'/><attribute name='message_parent' value=''/><branch><attribute name='name' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_id' value='62965'/><attribute name='message_title' value='Re: Week 8 '/><attribute name='message_date' value='04-11-08 14:45:05'/><attribute name='epoch_seconds' value='1225827905'/><attribute name='author' value='Nickolas Maslak'/><attribute name='type' value='message'/><attribute name='forum_id' value='24466'/><attribute name='topic_id' value='296967'/><attribute name='message_body' value='Sorry wrong section.

These television ratings tell me that media research really has no bearing on changing policies within the media because there a lot of things that are still not age appropriate for a certain age bracket that the so-called rating says are.
One potential problem that accompanies this rating system is that of the blanket solution. Another is that parents become too relaxed in their viewing choices for their children. They should not rely on a rating system and rather their own common sense. Another is that once a child sees what rating a TV program is their curiosity may be piqued because they know it&amp;rsquo;s something they are not allowed to view due to their age.
The rating system was developed by the television industry.
The Payne Fund Studies was research done over a span of time in which the effects of movies on children were studied. These studies provided the base to which the present day movie rating system is built on.
